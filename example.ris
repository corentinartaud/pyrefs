route for producing environmentally friendly materials. The reinforcement

based on zein-titanium dioxide (TiO

     ) complex (ZTC) microparticles,
is presented and used to produce composite filaments, successfully
3-dimensionally (3D) printed by fused deposition modeling (FDM). The
outcome of ZTC addition, ranging from 5 to 40 wt %, on the thermo-mechanical
properties of composite materials was analyzed. Results reveal that
storage modulus increased with increasing the ZTC content, leading
to a slight increase in the glass transition temperature. The creep
compliance varies with the ZTC concentration, denoting a better resistance
to deformation under constant stress conditions for composites with
higher complex content. Scanning electron microscopy was used to assess
the quality of interphase adhesion between PBAT and ZTC, showing good
dispersion and distribution of complex microparticles in the polymer
matrix. Infrared spectroscopy confirmed the formation of a valid interface
due to the formation of hydrogen bonds between filler and polymer
matrix. Preliminary tests on the biocompatibility of these materials
were also performed, showing no cytotoxic effects on cell viability.
Finally, the 3D printability of biobased composites was demonstrated
by realizing complex structures with a commercial FDM printer.

T1  - The Diffusion of Bioplastics: What Can We Learn From Poly(Lactic Acid)?
JO  - Sustainability
AB  - Environmental and social impacts caused by petrochemical plastics are generating significant concerns on a global scale. Bioplastics can contribute to the transition to more sustainable materials, but they did not expand at the expected rates in the early 2000s. With recent predictions indicating that the bioplastic capacities will almost triple in the next five years, what are the conditions that may now be combined to justify and enable such an expansion? This paper uses the case of PLA and general insights into other bioplastics (stylized facts) to detail these conditions. The results show that many bioplastics remained unused during the 20th Century, with interest increasing when plastic pollution became flagrant in the 1980s. For PLA, many efforts have been made to solve the technical and market issues, including through intense cooperation among stakeholders. While environmental concerns have propelled bioplastics, the general absence of structured end-of-life alternatives (e.g., recycling and composting infrastructures) hinders their diffusion. Conversely, the expanding regulations related to plastic pollution are now the primary driver of the growth of bioplastics. Therefore, for bioplastics, and especially PLA, the conditions seem to be emerging for them to diffuse at the predicted rates, but structural limitations in the bioplastics value chain still compromise the large-scale substitution of petrochemicals. This trend indicates that establishing end-of-life alternatives for bioplastics could help to remove the bottleneck in their diffusion process.

T1  - Oil Palm Fibre and Nano-Silica Reinforced Epoxy Composite Material
JO  - Advanced Materials Research
AB  - This paper presents a study on tensile properties of Nano Silicon Carbide (n-SiC) and oil palm fibre (OPF) reinforced epoxy composites. The dosage of n-SiC and OPF are limited to 0%, 1%, 3% &amp; 5% by mass of the total epoxy material. As a part of the research, experimental study is carried out on n-SiC and OPF based epoxy composites to investigate the tensile strength of the composite material. The utilization of 1% n-SiC&amp; 1% treated OPF shows an improvement in tensile strength compared to the pure epoxy. The experimental results are also compared with 3-D finite element analysis results and a good agreement is observed between the experimental and the finite element results.

T1  - Robust and Flexible Films From 100% Starch Cross-Linked by Biobased Disaccharide Derivative
JO  - Acs Sustainable Chemistry &Amp; Engineering
AB  - In this research, oxidized sucrose, a novel aldehyde-based green cross-linker, endowed starch films with substantial improvement in both tensile strength and elongation, whereas many other cross-linkers did not. Starch films are usually weak, brittle, and highly moisture sensitive, and thus have restricted industrial applications. Cross-linking is one of the most common methods to tackle these problems. However, most of the available cross-linkers are either toxic, expensive, or with low cross-linking efficiencies. Oxidized sucrose is a green cross-linker with multiple aldehyde groups per molecule to cross-link starch molecules via forming hemiacetals/acetals. The starch films cross-linked with oxidized sucrose had tensile strength and breaking elongation of 23 MPa and 60%, respectively, exceeding the cross-linking results of many other cross-linkers. Oxidized sucrose cross-linking also substantially increased the stability of starch films in both water and formic acid. With activation energy as low as 33.22 kJ mol −1 , the cross-linking, a pseudo-first-order reaction, could occur readily. Mild cross-linking using oxidized sucrose might provide an alternative to promote industrialization of starch-based products.

T1  - Silver Nanoparticles on Chitosan/Silica Nanofibers: Characterization and Antibacterial Activity
JO  - International Journal of Molecular Sciences
AB  - A simple, low-cost, and reproducible method for creating materials with even silver nanoparticles (AgNP) dispersion was established. Chitosan nanofibers with silica phase (CS/silica) were synthesized by an electrospinning technique to obtain highly porous 3D nanofiber scaffolds. Silver nanoparticles in the form of a well-dispersed metallic phase were synthesized in an external preparation step and embedded in the CS/silica nanofibers by deposition for obtaining chitosan nanofibers with silica phase decorated by silver nanoparticles (Ag/CS/silica). The antibacterial activity of investigated materials was tested using Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The results were compared with the properties of the nanocomposite without silver nanoparticles and a colloidal solution of AgNP. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of obtained AgNP against Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) ATCC25923 and Escherichia coli (E. coli) ATCC25922 was determined. The physicochemical characterization of Ag/CS/silica nanofibers using various analytical techniques, as well as the applicability of these techniques in the characterization of this type of nanocomposite, is presented. The resulting Ag/CS/silica nanocomposites (Ag/CS/silica nanofibers) were characterized by small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The morphology of the AgNP in solution, both initial and extracted from composite, the properties of composites, the size, and crystallinity of the nanoparticles, and the characteristics of the chitosan fibers were determined by electron microscopy (SEM and TEM).

T1  - Amorphous Sugar Materials as Sustainable and Scalable Alternatives for Rigid, Short-Term-Use Products
JO  - Acs Sustainable Chemistry &Amp; Engineering
AB  - Plastics are the prevailing materials for short-term-use applications, despite being designed to last far longer than often is needed or desired. This article describes a class of materials that are formed from small-molecule sugars, rather than polymers, as a scalable and environmentally friendly replacement for rigid thermoplastics for short-term-use applications. The materials use amorphous isomalt as a matrix and natural additives to tune the mechanical properties. Like plastics, this class of materials is lightweight and can be produced efficiently at low temperatures via injection molding, yet the materials emulate the rigidity and strength of ceramics and stones. Repeated recycling is achieved via a closed-loop process without degradation of the isomalt binder and without loss of mechanical properties. Finally, these materials are resistant to water for hours when coated, yet ultimately dissolve within minutes when broken, with the resulting products being nontoxic small-molecule and degradable biobased materials. This combination of traits makes amorphous isomalt materials suitable as an alternative to persistent plastics in short-term-use applications.

T1  - Characterization and Biodegradation Behavior of Bio-Based Poly(lactic Acid) and Soy Protein Blends for Sustainable Horticultural Applications
JO  - Green Chemistry
AB  - AbstractAdipic anhydride-plasticized soy protein (SP.A) was blended with poly(lactic acid) (PLA) at two concentrations (50/50 and 33/67) and was evaluated for use as a sustainable replacement for petroleum plastic in horticulture crop containers. Following the discovery that SP.A/PLA blends provide additional functions above that of petroleum plastic for this application, the present study evaluates the biodegradation behavior of these materials in soil and describes the substantial improvements in sustainability that result from the additional functions (intrinsic fertilizer and root improvement of plants) and the end-of-life option of biodegradation. After being buried in soil for designated time intervals, the residual degraded samples were analyzed to determine morphological and thermal properties at sequential stages of biodegradation. Samples were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The results indicated that there was a compatible system between SP.A and PLA in the melt. Incorporation of SP.A accelerated the biodegradation rate of this binary blend significantly compared with pure PLA. Prior to the degradation process, both the glass transition temperatures and melting temperatures of the blends containing SP.A decreased as the concentration of the soy protein increased. With increasing degradation time of the blended samples in soil, the glass transition temperatures increased in the early stages of biodegradation then decreased, a trend associated with the decrease in the molecular weight of the blends as a result of biodegradation. In addition, the thermal stability of blends increased gradually with increasing degradation time, suggesting faster biodegradation loss of the soy component of the SP.A/PLA blends. These results support the use of soy-based polymer blends for horticulture crop containers and provide data for evaluating their use as sustainable materials for other potential applications. 
Disciplines
ABSTRACTOne of the most significant limitations to widespread industrial implementation of emerging bioplastics such as poly(lactic acid) and poly(hydroxyalkanoate) (PHA) is that they do not match the flexibility and impact resistance of petroleum-based plastics like poly(propylene) or highdensity poly(ethylene). The basic goal of this research is to identify alternative, affordable, sustainable, biodegradable materials that can replace petroleum-based polymers in a wide range of industrial applications, with an emphasis on providing a solution for increasing the flexibility of PHA to a level that makes it a superior material for bioplastic nursery-crop containers. A series of bio-based PHA/poly(amide) (PA) blends with different concentrations were mechanically melt processed using a twin-screw extruder and evaluated for physical characteristics. The effects of blending on viscoelastic properties were investigated using smallamplitude oscillatory shear flow experimen...

T1  - Microbial Production of Lactic Acid: The Latest Development
JO  - Critical Reviews in Biotechnology
AB  - Lactic acid is an important platform chemical for producing polylactic acid (PLA) and other value-added products. It is naturally produced by a wide spectrum of microbes including bacteria, yeast and filamentous fungi. In general, bacteria ferment C5 and C6 sugars to lactic acid by either homo- or hetero-fermentative mode. Xylose isomerase, phosphoketolase, transaldolase, l- and d-lactate dehydrogenases are the key enzymes that affect the ways of lactic acid production. Metabolic engineering of microbial strains are usually needed to produce lactic acid from unconventional carbon sources. Production of d-LA has attracted much attention due to the demand for producing thermostable PLA, but large scale production of d-LA has not yet been commercialized. Thermophilic Bacillus coagulans strains are able to produce l-lactic acid from lignocellulose sugars homo-fermentatively under non-sterilized conditions, but the lack of genetic tools for metabolically engineering them severely affects their development for industrial applications. Pre-treatment of agriculture biomass to obtain fermentable sugars is a pre-requisite for utilization of the huge amounts of agricultural biomass to produce lactic acid. The major challenge is to obtain quality sugars of high concentrations in a cost effective-way. To avoid or minimize the use of neutralizing agents during fermentation, genetically engineering the strains to make them resist acidic environment and produce lactic acid at low pH would be very helpful for reducing the production cost of lactic acid.

T1  - Mechanical Properties of Calcium Phosphate Reinforced Polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) Biocomposite
JO  - Journal of Thermoplastic Composite Materials
AB  - In the area of bone tissue engineering, the concept of using biomaterials based bone scaffolds in the regeneration of critical size bone defects is a key element to development of alternatives to allogenic and autogolous bone graft. Globally, countries all over the world is experiencing population aging besides other bone defects related case including trauma, pathology and congenital defects. Calcium phosphate (CaP) has received much interest for broad range of bone substitutes since its physicochemical properties can be conveniently tailored with close resemblance to human bone constituents. In this study the mechanical properties of Polyhydroxyalakanoate (PHA)/CaP composite were investigated. CaP was reinforced in PHA in the range from 5 wt% to 30 wt% and the tensile and impact properties of the composite were investigated. The addition of CaP showed fluctuation value in both tensile strength and impact strength starting with drop at approximately three times lower than neat PHA. The maximum tensile stress recorded at 15 wt% of CaP was 7.93 MPa along with elastic modulus of 102.416 MPa while the minimum tensile stress recorded at 30 wt% of CaP was 2.423 MPa with elastic modulus of 49.455 MPa. In parallel, the highest impact strength showed at 15 wt% of CaP was 5.761 kJ/m2 while the lowest mechanical strength recorded at 30 wt% of CaP content. Morphological analysis demonstrates the crack surface of each sample with CaP inclusion in supporting the development of brittleness in nature of biocomposite throughout the inclusion of CaP osteo-filler. Admittedly, the finding of this study will contribute to development of PHA based scaffolds for bone tissue with compromise mechanical properties along with their biological performance identical or similar to that of an ancient graft or transplant upon implantation.

T1  - The Influence of Adding Glycerol and Spirulina on the Characteristics of Starch-Based Bioplastics Film From Potato Peel Waste
JO  - Hydrogen Jurnal Kependidikan Kimia
AB  - The development of bioplastic films is one of the efforts to reduce plastic waste. The polymer used as the basic material for making bioplastic films is starch. Potato peel waste can be repurposed by extracting its starch content. This research has the purpose to investigate the influence of adding glycerol and spirulina on the characteristics of bioplastic films made from potato peel starch, and to ascertain the optimum composition of raw materials. Bioplastics were produced by casting method from potato peel starch with variations of glycerol and spirulina. The bioplastic composition in this research includes K0 (0 ml glycerol and 0 grams spirulina), K1 (2.5 ml glycerol and 0.3 grams spirulina), K2 (1.25 ml glycerol and 0.3 grams spirulina), K3 (2.5 ml glycerol and 0.15 grams spirulina), and K4 (1.25 ml glycerol and 0.15 grams spirulina). The characteristics of bioplastic films include thickness testing, tensile strength, elongation at break, and degradation. The results from the characterization of bioplastic films indicate that the addition of glycerol and spirulina is inversely proportional to the tensile strength produced, meaning it decreases. However, the addition of glycerol and spirulina is directly proportional to the percentage of elongation produced, meaning it increases. The addition of spirulina has an impact on the degradation time of bioplastic films. The optimal raw material ratio in this research is found in sample K4, with a tensile strength value of 23.038 MPa, elongation at break of 4.385%, thickness of 0.1367 mm, and complete degradation occurring on the sixth day.

T1  - Socio-Economic Importance of Biomaterials in the Transition to the Circular Economy Model
JO  - SHS Web of Conferences
AB  - Research background: The adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development obliges individual countries to take actions aimed at achieving the seventeen goals of sustainable development. One of the tasks is to transform the economy into a circular economy. The necessity of transformation results from the growing number of manufactured products and the growing amount of generated waste, especially those made of plastics. Waste management and disposal may also have significant environmental effects. Therefore, EU waste management policy aims to reduce the impact of waste on the environment and health and to improve the efficient use of resources in the EU. The long-term goal of this policy is to reduce the amount of waste generated, and if its generation is unavoidable, to promote its use as resources, to increase recycling and to ensure safe disposal of waste. Hence the need to change the current economic model based on a linear approach to the circular economy. The technological goal of the circular economy is to achieve the highest possible level of waste recovery and recycling, and then reuse it in production. A possible alternative to conventional and petroleum-based materials are biopolymers that are biodegradable in the natural environment, and their degradation products do not endanger human and animal health. Thanks to these properties they not only can replace traditional polymers, but also will find completely new applications in biomedical engineering and medicine.
Purpose of the article: The aim of the article is to analyze the socio-economic consequences of using biomaterials in the transition to the GOZ model.
Methods: A systematic literature review methodology.
Findings &amp; Value added: The main findings relate to the socio-economic consequences of introducing biomaterials for both consumers and businesses.

JO  - Acs Omega
AB  - In this research,
CuO nanostructures doped with Ag and cellulose
nanocrystals (CNC) were synthesized using a facile coprecipitation
technique. In this work, we doped Ag into fixed quantities of CNC
and CuO to improve the photocatalytic, catalytic, and antibacterial
activity. It was noted that catalytic activity increased upon doping,
which was attributed to the formation of nanorods and a pH effect,
while the reverse trend was observed in photocatalytic activity. The
addition of Ag and CNC dopants into CuO improved the bactericidal
efficacy for
     
      S. aureus
     
     and
     
      E. coli
     
     . In addition, to obtain insight into the
possible mechanism behind their biocidal effects, molecular docking
studies were conducted against specific enzyme targets: namely, dihydrofolate
reductase from
     
      E. coli
     
     and DNA gyrase
from
     
      S. aureus
     
     . This study suggested
that codoped CuO could be highly efficient in the cleaning of polluted
water and antibacterial applications.

T1  - Fabrication and Characterization of Starch Based Bioplastics With Palm Oil Addition
JO  - Jurnal Sains Materi Indonesia
AB  - FABRICATION AND CHARACTERIZATION OF STARCH BASED BIOPLASTICS WITH PALM OIL ADDITION. In this work, starch-based bioplastics in advancing its properties were positively arranged with the addition of palm oil. Starch-based bioplastics were produced by dry blending method and compression technique with mixing starch and glycerol (3:1, w/w) then adding palm oil at various concentration (0%, 2.5%, 5% and 7.5% w/w). Morphology of bioplastics presented that palm oil wrapped bioplastics granules which influenced hydrophobicity properties of bioplastics compared by increasing contact angle of bioplastics from 45.95 o (0% of palm oil) to 61.98 o (5% of palm oil). This result indicated that the addition of palm oil could develop the properties of bioplastics to hold absorbing water molecules. Moreover, the melting point of bioplastics also affected shifting temperature from 115 o C to be 100 o C that could save the energy needed during heating process. FTIR analysis showed that C=O group at wavenumber 1747 cm -1 was dependable the interaction between starch-glycerol and palm oil. Furthermore, the addition of palm oil would accelerate the biodegradation process. Although the mechanical properties of bioplastics have not increased, the addition of palm oil on bioplastics fabrication is an alternative to improve the characteristic of bioplastics, especially physical, thermal, hydrophobicity and biodegradation properties.

T1  - Improvement in Impact Strength of Modified Cardanol‐bonded Cellulose Thermoplastic Resin by Adding Modified Silicones
JO  - Journal of Applied Polymer Science
AB  - ABSTRACT: The impact strength of cellulose diacetate (CDA) bonded with a modified cardanol (3-pentadecylphenoxy acetic acid: PAA) was greatly improved up to 9 kJ/m 2 by adding a relatively small amount of modified silicones while suppressing a decrease in bending strength. In our recent research, this thermoplastic resin (PAA-bonded CDA) exhibited high rigidity, glass transition temperature, and water resistance. However, its impact strength was insufficient for use in durable products. Therefore, silicones modified with polyether, amino, and epoxy groups were investigated as possible ways to improve the impact strength. The results show that adding polyether-modified silicone (polyether silicone) with moderate polarity relative to PAA-bonded CDA resulted in shearing deformation greatly enhances its impact strength while maintaining other properties, including glass transition temperature (T g ), water resistance, and thermoplasticity.

T1  - Polylactic Acid/Epoxidized Natural Rubber Biofoams: Modelling and Water Absorption
JO  - Scienceasia
AB  - Biofoams containing polylactic acid (PLA) and an epoxidized natural rubber (ENR-50) were prepared using various chemical foaming agents (CFA). The factors that affect the properties and characteristics of the biodegradable foams were epoxidized natural rubber (ENR)-50 and CFA contents. ENR-50 is one of the toughening agents used for blending with PLA by twin-screw extruder followed by compression moulding. Water absorption increased with increasing ENR-50 and CFA contents, due to the effect of polarity and natural hydrophilicity of the oxirane groups of ENR-50. The percentage crystallinity decreased with the addition of ENR-50 and CFA, due to the interaction between the epoxy groups of the ENR-50 and the carbonyl groups of the PLA, which makes movement more difficult and hinders the arrangement of the crystal. The addition of ENR in blend foam led to the increase of impact strength. Whereas the flexural strength of PLA/ENR foams decreased with increased ENR content. The impact strength and flexural strength of PLA/ENR-50 foams were investigated and the experimental data were analysed through SPSS and MATLAB, to optimize as well as to determine the significance of the factors affecting the impact strength and flexural strength of the foams. The parameterization of the mathematical method for different content of the initial controlled substance was achieved by fitting the mathematical model with the experimental data for impact strength and flexural strength. The 3-D curves obtained from the proposed mathematical models were plotted.

T1  - Land Use Mediated GHG Emissions and Spillovers From Increased Consumption of Bioplastics
JO  - Environmental Research Letters
AB  - Bioplastic production is a small but fast growing sector in the global bioeconomy, which may benefit from public support measures in the future as governments seek to promote more sustainable consumption patterns. Here we assess the potential net economy-wide impacts of a 5% bioplastic target relative to current plastic consumption in the main producing regions. We compare two alternative policy strategies to achieve the target in a general equilibrium framework that allows for substitution between conventional and bio-based plastics: a subsidy on bioplastics versus a tax on fossil-based plastic consumption. Our study is the first to quantify global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from an increased demand for bioplastics on a global scale, produced from arable crops, considering both direct and indirect land use change (LUC). The tax provokes a contraction of all sectors that employ plastics, which leads to a drop of 0.07% in global real GDP, whereas the subsidy has no significant effect on the global economy. Both tax and subsidy reduce world demand for petroleum products, by 0.37% and 0.07%, respectively, boosting demand for sugar-and starch-based feedstock in the bioplastic industry. This leads to emissions from LUC globally, which correspond to a carbon payback time of 22 years on average, with the associated annual abatement costs of over US$2000 per tonne of CO 2 -eq. The tax has greater GHG reduction potential in bioplastic producing regions but generates greater economic and environmental spillover effects in countries that do not enforce the target. Results show that promoting bioplastic consumption is not a cost-effective strategy for climate change mitigation if based on conventional feedstock, due to market-mediated GHG emissions from LUC. Bioplastics are not necessarily more sustainable than conventional polymers just because they are biobased, although further assessment of potential environmental gains associated with biodegradability and recyclability is desirable.

T1  - Challenges in the Context of Single-Use Plastics and Bioplastics in Brazil: A Legislative Review
JO  - Waste Management &Amp; Research the Journal for a Sustainable Circular Economy
AB  - Plastic has been present in our lives for the past century as an essential material for many commodity items. However, the same properties that make plastic convenient are also responsible for the current dramatic environmental pollution. As an alternative, most of the world has been working with technological innovations, and one of its strategies is the use of bioplastics. Despite being considered environmentally beneficial by some people, there are still developments and discussions that need to be made. This article aims to present a legislative review and discusses the difficulty in implementing policies related to the incentive of the bioplastics market, as well as presenting some state and municipal laws, already prohibiting single-use plastics in Brazil. These laws aim to encourage the substitution of these plastics for biodegradable ones. However, it still has gaps and a lack of clarification on how the banning of disposable plastics and their substitution will be beneficial since composting is still an incipient process in the country. It is also the purpose of this article to discuss the challenges in the context of the Circular Economy, as well as the potential solution based on the creation of public policies aimed at improving waste management, in addition to clearer legislation on alternatives to single-use plastics.

T1  - Fabric‐Based TENG Woven With Bio‐Fabricated Superhydrophobic Bacterial Cellulose Fiber for Energy Harvesting and Motion Detection
JO  - Advanced Functional Materials
AB  - AbstractFabric‐based triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) exhibit superior output performance, flexibility, and wearability. However, the fabric structure often creates gaps that accumulate contaminants, which weaken the performance and durability of the TENGs. To address this challenge, a novel eco‐friendly superhydrophobic fabric‐based TENG (SF‐TENG) woven with superhydrophobic electroconductive bacterial cellulose fiber (SEBC fiber) is presented. To construct durable superhydrophobicity, an ingenious bio‐fabricated method is employed for the shell–core structure. SEBC fibers with bio‐fabricated shell–core structure exhibit excellent electroconductibility, mechanical property, biodegradability, and durable superhydrophobicity. SF‐TENG displays a maximum open‐circuit voltage of 266.0 V, a short‐circuit current of 5.9 µA, and an output power of 489.7 µW, and successfully powers devices such as stopwatch and calculator. Abilities of self‐cleaning and anti‐fouling guarantee the stable output performance of SF‐TENG under harsh environmental conditions such as liquids pouring. Furthermore, the intelligent clothing is designed based on SF‐TENG to detect motion signals, and it is further utilized to construct a Sports and Health Monitoring System as a deep application. In summary, this study provides a novel strategy of bio‐fabrication for the design and preparation of superhydrophobic electroconductive fiber with shell–core structure. The SF‐TENG demonstrates practicability, stability and is promising for wearable devices in harsh environmental conditions.

JO  - C – Journal of Carbon Research
AB  - This work reports on membranes of a combination of chitosan–starch with lithium-modified multiwall carbon nanotubes. One of the most important contributions of this article is the functionalization of the surface of multiwall carbon nanotubes by means of an accessible technique that allows for high grafting yields of lithium and their incorporation into a polymeric matrix. The natural compounds chitosan and starch were used as a support to embed the nanotubes, forming membranes with good mechanical stability. A thorough characterization via Raman, infrared and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopies, transmission and scanning electron microscopies and dynamic mechanical analysis is presented here, as well as electrochemical characterization. The composition, structure and mechanical stability of the membranes make them viable candidates to be used as anodes sustainable Li-ion batteries.

T1  - Spent Grain: A Functional Ingredient for Food Applications
JO  - Foods
AB  - Spent grain is the solid fraction remaining after wort removal. It is nutritionally rich, composed of fibers—mainly hemicellulose, cellulose, and lignin—proteins, lipids, vitamins, and minerals, and must be managed properly. Spent grain is a by-product with high moisture, high protein and high fiber content and is susceptible to microbial contamination; thus, a suitable, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly valorization method of processing it is required. This by-product is used as a raw material in the production of many other food products—bakery products, pasta, cookies, muffins, wafers, snacks, yogurt or plant-based yogurt alternatives, Frankfurter sausages or fruit beverages—due to its nutritional values. The circular economy is built on waste reduction and the reuse of by-products, which find opportunities in the regeneration and recycling of waste materials and energy that become inputs in other processes and food products. Waste disposal in the food industry has become a major issue in recent years when attempting to maintain hygiene standards and avoid soil, air and water contamination. Fortifying food products with spent grain follows the precepts of the circular bio-economy and industrial symbiosis of strengthening sustainable development. The purpose of this review is to update information on the addition of spent grain to various foods and the influence of spent grain on these foods.

T1  - Poultry Feather Disulphide Bond Breakdown to Enable Bio-Based Polymer Production
JO  - Polymers From Renewable Resources
AB  - With oil supplies, needed for plastic production, decreasing dramatically, there is a clear driver for alterative polymers from sustainable resources. Poultry feathers, containing ∼90% keratin, are one source of natural polymer with huge potential for biopolymer production. However, the presence of crosslinks, known as disulphide bonds, hinders processability. This paper reviews techniques to enable breakage of disulphide bonds through use of reduction agents (sodium sulphite and sodium sulphate) and hydrolysis. Samples were analysed using FTIR and DSC to quantify achievable bond breakage, effect on thermal properties and changes in protein concentration. A review on the effect of particle size on disulphide bond breakage was also conducted, along with quantifying the reformation of bonds post-processing. Finally, a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay was used to quantify changes to soluble protein content, key to predicting if biopolymer formation can occur. The results showed a final disulphide bond breakage of between 48% and 67% was achievable using these techniques. It was also shown that disulphide bond content exhibited up to 60% bond reformation post treatment. These reductions in disulphide bonds increased the thermoplastic nature and apparent protein content. Despite achieving the highest bond breakage percentage, hydrolysis caused degradation of useful proteins, rendering the material unsuitable for biopolymer production. Results suggested that treatment with sodium sulphite (4.3% wt. of feathers) and use of a small particle size (0–100 µm), sufficiently altered the properties of raw feathers to enable feather biopolymer production.

T1  - Effect of Brewery Spent Grain on the Growth and Yield of Sorghum (Sorghum Bicolor (L.) Moench)
JO  - Sustainability Agri Food and Environmental Research
AB  - A field experiment was conducted at the Teaching and Research Farm, Ambrose Alli University, Ekpoma to investigate the effect of brewery spent grain on the growth and yield of sorghum. Treatment consisted of five rates of brewery spent grain (BSG) (0, 2, 4, 6 and 8 t/ha). The experiment was a randomized complete block design (RCBD) with three replicates. Sorghum variety (ABS 4540 AMZU) was used as a test crop. The parameters measured included: plant height, leaf area, number of leaves/plant at 3, 6 and 9 weeks after planting (WAP). Whole plant dry matter yield and grain weight were also determined. The results obtained showed that BSG treatments had significantly (P&lt;0.05) higher plant height, leaf area and number of leaves than the control in all the weeks after planting, except for number of leaves at 3 WAP. At 3 and 6 WAP, the tallest plants (21.33 cm and 33.05 cm) were obtained from crops treated with 8 t/ha BSG while those treated with 6 t/ha BSG had the tallest plant (95.04 cm) at 9 WAP. 6 t/ha BSG recorded the highest leaf area at 3, 6 and 9 WAP.  At 6 WAP, the highest number of leaves (9.00) was observed from plants which received the application of 6 t/ha BSG. However, control had the highest number of leaves (10.00) than BSG treatments. The highest grain yield (2.54 t/ha) and dry matter yield (3.80 g) were obtained from crops which received the application of 6 and 8 t/ha BSG, respectively. Keywords: Brewery Spent Grain, Growth, Sorghum, Yield.

T1  - Optimal Iron Concentrations for Growth-Associated Polyhydroxyalkanoate Biosynthesis in the Marine Photosynthetic Purple bacteriumRhodovulum Sulfidophilum
AB  - 26 Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) are a group of natural biopolyesters that resemble petroleum-27 derived plastics in terms of physical properties but are less harmful biologically to the 28 environment and humans. Most of the current PHA producers are heterotrophs, which require 29 expensive feeding materials and thus contribute to the high price of PHAs. Marine 30 photosynthetic bacteria are promising alternative microbial cell factories for cost-effective, 31 carbon neutral and sustainable production of PHAs. In this study, Rhodovulum sulfidophilum, 32 a marine photosynthetic purple nonsulfur bacterium with a high metabolic versatility, was 33 evaluated for cell growth and PHA production under the influence of various media 34 components found in previous studies. We evaluated iron, using ferric citrate, as another 35 essential factor for cell growth and efficient PHA production and confirmed that PHA 36 production in R. sulfidophilum was growth-associated under microaerobic and 37 photoheterotrophic conditions. In fact, a subtle amount of iron (1 to 2 µM) was sufficient to 38 promote rapid cell growth and biomass accumulation, as well as a high PHA yield during the 39 logarithmic phase. However, an excess amount of iron did not enhance the growth rate or 40 PHA productivity. Thus, we successfully confirmed that an optimum concentration of iron, 41 an essential nutrient, promotes cell growth in R. sulfidophilum and also enhances PHA 42 utilization. 43 44 Introduction 45 Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) are a family of biopolyesters that are produced by a wide 46 variety of microorganisms for the purpose of surviving in unfavorable growth and stress 47 conditions; these molecules act as carbon and energy storage, redox regulators and 48 cryoprotectants [1-3]. PHA is one of the well-known bioplastics (biobased and 49 biodegradable) that has been extensively developed with the aims to overcome problems such 3 50 as plastic solid wastes, harmful chemical substance leaching and dependence on 51 nonrenewable fossil fuels. These are the main disadvantages of petroleum-derived synthetic 52 plastics [4, 5]. 53 54 However, the high price of PHAs has made them less competitive compared to conventional 55 synthetic plastics due to the high cost of raw materials used in fermentation and downstream 56 purification steps [6-8]. Heterotroph bacteria such as wild-type or engineered strains of 57 Cupriavidus necator H16, Alcaligenes latus, Pseudomonas putida and Escherichia coli are 58 the main workhorses for large-scale production of PHAs [9-11]. These heterotroph bacteria 59 lack photosynthesis ability and thus require expensive carbon supplies to sustain their growth 60 and PHA biosynthesis. On the other hand, photosynthetic microorganisms could produce 61 their own foods by utilizing inexpensive and abundantly available resources such as sunlight,62 carbon dioxide and nitrogen and are thus potential next-generation microbial cell factories 63 [12, 13]. Several studies have reported successful PHA production by photosynthetic bact...

T1  - Enhancement of Physical and Mechanical Properties of Dioscorea Dumetorum Starch Films With Dialdehyde Starch Solution
JO  - Starch - Stärke
AB  - The influence of varying amount of dialdehyde starch solution on the physical and mechanical properties of bitter yam starch‐based biofilms were investigated. Proportional increase in film thickness (0.20–0.26 mm), density (1.15 to 1.43 g cm−3) and opacity (0.92 to 1.04%) were observed from neat film (Film0) to film with highest dialdehyde starch content (Film3) respectively. The moisture content and film solubility after 24 h depicted an inverse relationship with the amount of the added dialdehyde starch solution. From Film0 to Film3, moisture content reduced from 11.40 to 9.32%, while solubility reduced from 13.61 to 6.46% correspondingly. It was further found that addition of higher amount of dialdehyde starch led to longer biodegradable duration and lesser water absorption capacity of the bioplastics. There was great improvement in mechanical properties of the bioplastics as twofold increase in tensile strength and threefold increase in rigidity from Film0 to Film3 were recorded. The result of elongation at break shows a reverse order of 0.50 at Film0 bioplastic to 0.31 at Film3 bioplastic. Therefore, the results of the study suggest that the properties of starch‐based bioplastic film could be enhanced by adding dialdehyde starch solution.

T1  - Protein and Polysaccharide-Based Optical Materials for Biomedical Applications
JO  - International Journal of Molecular Sciences
AB  - Recent advances in biomedical research, particularly in optical applications, have sparked a transformative movement towards replacing synthetic polymers with more biocompatible and sustainable alternatives. Most often made from plastics or glass, these materials ignite immune responses from the body, and their production is based on environmentally harsh oil-based processes. Biopolymers, including both polysaccharides and proteins, have emerged as a potential candidate for optical biomaterials due to their inherent biocompatibility, biodegradability, and sustainability, derived from their existence in nature and being recognized by the immune system. Current extraction and fabrication methods for these biomaterials, including thermal drawing, extrusion and printing, mold casting, dry-jet wet spinning, hydrogel formations, and nanoparticles, aim to create optical materials in cost-effective and environmentally friendly manners for a wide range of applications. Present and future applications include optical waveguides and sensors, imaging and diagnostics, optical fibers, and waveguides, as well as ocular implants using biopolymers, which will revolutionize these fields, specifically their uses in the healthcare industry.

T1  - Carboxymethyl Cellulose-Blended Films From Rice Stubble as a New Potential Biopolymer Source to Reduce Agricultural Waste: A Mini Review
JO  - Chemistry &Amp; Chemical Technology
AB  - The vegetative part of the rice plant, Oryza sativa L., that remains after paddy fields have been cleared during harvest or afterward is known as rice stubble. Carboxymethyl Cellulose from Rice Stubble (CMCr) is a promising biopolymer source that can be made from rice stubble waste. Carboxymethyl cellulose was synthesized from rice stubble by a solvent-casting method. Various types of plasticizers (glycerol and olive oil) and the components they contain provide flexibility for use as a material for food packaging. The films' moisture barrier was enhanced by the olive oil content while their extensibility was enhanced by the glycerol content. Indonesia is known as a country with the majority of the population working as farmers. Along with the increase in rice harvested area each year, agricultural waste in the form of rice stubble is also increasing. In the future, the application of CMCr in food packaging has the potential to revolutionize sustainable practices in Indonesia's agricultural sector. By leveraging CMCr's unique properties, such as enhanced moisture barrier and increased extensibility, there is an opportunity to develop eco-friendly packaging solutions. This innovation not only addresses the challenge of rising rice stubble waste but also contributes to the reduction of environmental pollution, offering a greener and more sustainable approach to packaging in the country.

T1  - Poly(hydroxyalkanoates): Production, Applications and End-of-Life Strategies–Life Cycle Assessment Nexus
JO  - Acs Sustainable Chemistry &Amp; Engineering
AB  - The runaway production and consumption of oilbased plastics are key drivers of global warming and the increased carbon footprint. Besides, most of this plastic debris ends up in the oceans and constitutes about 80% of all marine debris. This pollution problem calls for a seismic shift to eco-friendly plastics and marine biodegradable ones. Unlike other biobased polymers, polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) take pride in their degradation in soil and marine environments. This intriguing marine biodegradation property of PHAs sets it apart as the best choice to curb microplastics, particularly in marine ecosystems. PHAs have also grown in popularity due to other quintessential properties such as biocompatibility, structural variety, and similarity to conventional plastics in terms of physical properties. PHAs are being widely researched for various applications, including packaging, medical, energy, and agriculture. This perspective comprehensively focuses on the state-of-art production and applications of PHA plastics as well as the practical recycling strategies for postconsumer PHAs. The innovative "next generation industrial biotechnology" (NGIB) is well covered in this perspective. Moreover, the nexus between end-of-life strategies and life cycle assessment (LCA) of PHAs waste is elucidated to understand its impact on the environment thoroughly.

T1  - Life Cycle Assessment of PLA Products: A Systematic Literature Review
JO  - Sustainability
AB  - The rising concerns about environmental harm and pollution create a setting for the search for better materials to produce more sustainable products. Plastic plays a crucial role in modern life and most of the commonly used are of fossil origin. Polylactic Acid (PLA) has been appointed as a more sustainable alternative, due to its origins in biodegradable raw materials. This paper aims to review scientific research, where Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is performed on this material, in order to further understand the environmental impacts and to assess whether it is a more viable option when compared to the most commonly used plastics. A systematic literature review of 81 LCA studies focused on the LCA of PLA products was conducted. An assessment of key aspects, including the system boundaries, raw materials origin, and quantitative analysis of five environmental impact categories was performed. In this comparative analysis, in addition to presenting the results for PLA products, they are also compared with other fossil-based plastics. This leads to the conclusion that PLA has higher environmental impacts on Marine Eutrophication, Freshwater Eutrophication, and Human Toxicity, which are mainly related to the agricultural phase of growing the raw materials for PLA production. For Climate Change, Polystyrene (PS) presents the higher Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions, and for the Ozone Layer Depletion category, Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) presents the higher impact. PLA is a solution to replace fossil plastics. However, the use of alternative biomass sources without competition with the feed and food sector could be a key option for biobased materials production, with lower environmental and socioeconomic impacts. This will be a pathway to reduce environmental impacts in categories such as climate change, marine eutrophication, and freshwater eutrophication.

T1  - Rational Design and Characterization of Bioplastics From Hermetia Illucens Prepupae Proteins
JO  - Biopolymers
AB  - Abstract
In this study proteins extracted from prepupae of Hermetia illucens, also known as black soldier fly, are investigated as promising base for a new type of bioplastics for agricultural purposes. Design of experiments techniques are employed to perform a rational study on the effects of different combination of glycerol as plasticizer, citric acid as cross‐linking agent and distilled water as solvent on the capability of proteins to form a free‐standing film through casting technique, keeping as fixed the quantity of proteins. Glycerol shows interesting properties as plasticizer contributing to the formation of homogenous and free‐standing film. Moreover, mechanical and thermal characterizations are performed to estimate the effect of increasing amounts of proteins on the final properties and thickness of the specimens. Proteins derived from H. illucens can be successfully employed as base for bioplastics to be employed for agricultural purposes.

T1  - Rethinking Sustainability: A Research on Starch Based Bioplastic
JO  - Journal of Sustainable Construction Materials and Technologies
AB  - Based on the need to rely on sustainable feedstock, depend less on fossil resources and decrease carbon emissions, biomaterials and bioplastics as substitutes of conventional petroleum based plastics have been the focus of many material scientists, architects and industrial product designers. Therefore, this article is an experimentation on the possibilities of starch based bioplastic production. The focus of the article is to understand the limits of this new material and figure out whether starch based bioplastic material can be used in architecture, both as a facade material and an interior space furnishing. Based on Steven's bioplastic formula, starch based bioplastic is produced handmade as a surface and cubic specimens with different developed variations in this article. Different starch types, such as potato, corn, wheat and tapioca are tested and mixed with pellets known as local agricultural waste, natural fibers and aggregates. Within the research bioplastic produced from potato starch is formed and molded firstly as a sheet and secondly as a three-dimensional material and tested for vulnerability and durability. The research expands to understanding how organic and inorganic interventions can be made in order to increase the life span of the material, make it durable and resistant to humid and weather conditions. It is observed that tapioca starch gives the finest, smoothest, flexible and strengthful biopolymer among all. Issues on sustainability, designing and sensing the unpredictable and searching for "new" materials for a greener and sustainable future are the main core of bioplastic production. Regarding the negative carbon footprint and long-term environmental effects of fossil-based plastics through landfill and incineration, the search for such a material brings forth a deeper material experience along with a further collaboration of architects and engineering disciplines. Through this production, we need to figure out deeply the nature of new starch based materials in architecture, which are eco-friendly, cheaper and more strengthful materials compared to conventional synthesized polymers.

T1  - Towards Less Plastic in Food Contact Materials: An in-Depth Overview of the Belgian Market
JO  - Foods
AB  - The food contact materials (FCMs) industry is forced to develop substitute materials due to constant pressure from consumers and authorities to reduce fossil-based plastic. Several alternatives are available on the market. However, market share, trends, and consumer preferences are still unclear. Therefore, this study aims to provide an overview of the Belgian FCMs market, the available substitute materials, and their uses. The market analysis was performed with an integrated web-based approach. Fifty-two sources were investigated, covering e-shops selling materials intended to replace disposable plastic materials or being advertised as environmentally friendly and websites describing homemade FCMs. The first screening identified 10,523 articles. The following data cleaning process resulted in a homogeneous dataset containing 2688 unique entries, systematically categorised into fifteen material categories and seven utilisation classes. Paper and board was the most popular material category (i.e., 37% of the entries), followed by bagasse, accounting for 9% of the entries. Takeaway and food serving (44.4% and 22.8% of the entries) were the most common usage categories. The study pursued to provide insights into current trends and consumer preferences, highlighting priorities for safety assessment and future policy making.

T1  - Sutureless Repair of Corneal Injuries Using Naturally Derived Bioadhesive Hydrogels
JO  - Science Advances
AB  - Corneal injuries are common causes of visual impairment worldwide. Accordingly, there is an unmet need for transparent biomaterials that have high adhesion, cohesion, and regenerative properties. Herein, we engineer a highly biocompatible and transparent bioadhesive for corneal reconstruction using a visible light cross-linkable, naturally derived polymer, GelCORE (gel for corneal regeneration). The physical properties of GelCORE could be finely tuned by changing prepolymer concentration and photocrosslinking time. GelCORE revealed higher tissue adhesion compared to commercial adhesives. Furthermore, in situ photopolymerization of GelCORE facilitated easy delivery to the cornea, allowing for bioadhesive curing precisely according to the required geometry of the defect. In vivo experiments, using a rabbit stromal defect model, showed that bioadhesive could effectively seal corneal defects and induce stromal regeneration and re-epithelialization. Overall, GelCORE has many advantages including low cost and ease of production and use. This makes GelCORE a promising bioadhesive for corneal repair.

T1  - The Influence of Additives and Environment on Biodegradation of PHBV Biocomposites
JO  - Polymers
AB  - The biodegradation of polyhydroxybutyrate-co-hydroxyvalerate (PHBV) ternary biocomposites containing nature-based plasticizer acetyl tributyl citrate (ATBC), heterogeneous nucleation agents—calcium carbonate (CaCO3) and spray-dried lignin-coated cellulose nanocrystals (L-CNC)—in vermicomposting, freshwater biotope, and thermophilic composting have been studied. The degree of disintegration, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and the evaluation of surface images taken by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were conducted for the determination influence of different environments and additives on the biodegradation of PHBV. Furthermore, the method adapted from ISO 14855-1 standard was used for thermophilic composting. It is a method based on the measurement of the amount of carbon dioxide evolved during microbial degradation. The highest biodegradation rate was observed in the thermophilic condition of composting. The biodegradation level of all PHBV-based samples was, after 90 days, higher than 90%. Different mechanisms of degradation and consequently different degradation rate were evaluated in vermicomposting and freshwater biotope. The surface enzymatic degradation, observed during the vermicomposting process, showed slightly higher biodegradation potential than the hydrolytic attack of freshwater biotope. The application of ATBC plasticizers in the PHBV matrix caused an increase in biodegradation rate in all environments. However, the highest biodegradation rate was achieved for ternary PHBV biocomposites containing 10 wt. % of ATBC and 10 wt. % of CaCO3. A considerable increase in the degree of disintegration was evaluated, even in freshwater biotope. Furthermore, the slight inhibition effect of L-CNC on the biodegradation process of ternary PHBV/ATBC/L-CNC could be stated.

T1  - Development of a New Method for Obtaining the Bioplastics Based on Microbial Biopolymers and Lignin
JO  - Innovative Biosystems and Bioengineering
AB  - Background. The ever-increasing demand for plastic polymer products with simultaneous depleting fossil fuels such as oil and natural gas, as well as the growing problem of waste disposal, creates a need to find alternative technologies that meet current trends in both environmental and economic development. Bioplastic materials that are synthesized from renewable sources and have the ability to biodegrade are considered as such an alternative. The main obstacle of modern bioplastics which makes it impossible to completely replace traditional plastics is the high cost of production. In order to reduce the cost of existing biopolymers, production waste is added to the polymer matrix. One such waste is lignin – the second most common biopolymer. An additional way to reduce the cost of production is to find more cost-effective producers. Thus, although the classical microbial synthesis has fairly high productivity, the source of carbon for the cultivation of microorganisms are sugars obtained from agricultural raw materials which could cause a threat for food industry. The new producer for production of polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) is cyanobacteria, the carbon source of which is carbon (IV) oxide or gas emissions from enterprises, which reduces the cost of the target product.
Objective. Development of a method for obtaining bioplastics using products of microbial synthesis and lignin.
Methods. Cyanobacteria Nostoc commune was grown using a nutrient medium BG-11 with subsequent limitation of Nitrogen for the synthesis of PHA. Hydrolyzed lignin from hardwoods was combined with polylactic acid (PLA) or cyanobacteria-synthesized PHA in different ratios with further casting of the solution to determine the ability of lignin and polymer matrix to form polymer films.
Results. The content of PHA in the cells of cyanobacteria Nostoc commune, when grown in a nutrient medium limited to Nitrogen, reached 7.8%. The synthesized polymer films based on PLA and lignin were not homogeneous, and films based on PHA and lignin were fragile.
Conclusions. The possibility of obtaining PHA by using cyanobacteria of the Nostoc commune species under environmental conditions that differ from the optimal ones for both cultivation and PHA production is shown. The possibility of obtaining a biopolymer based on lignin and PLA is shown. To form homogeneous films, it is necessary to change the standard conditions for obtaining a mixture of components. The interaction of lignin with PHA forms a homogeneous polymer mixture, which is fragile and requires the addition of plasticizers to obtain the necessary properties.

T1  - Synthesis and Characterization of Polyhydroxyalkanoate/Graphene Oxide/Nanoclay Bionanocomposites: Experimental Results and Theoretical Predictions via Machine Learning Models
JO  - Biomolecules
AB  - Predicting the mechanical properties of multiscale nanocomposites requires simulations that are costly from a practical viewpoint and time consuming. The use of algorithms for property prediction can reduce the extensive experimental work, saving time and costs. To assess this, ternary poly(hydroxybutyrate-co-hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV)-based bionanocomposites reinforced with graphene oxide (GO) and montmorillonite nanoclay were prepared herein via an environmentally friendly electrochemical process followed by solution casting. The aim was to evaluate the effectiveness of different Machine Learning (ML) models, namely Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Decision Tree (DT), and Support Vector Machine (SVM), in predicting their mechanical properties. The algorithms’ input data were the Young’s modulus, tensile strength, and elongation at break for various concentrations of the nanofillers (GO and nanoclay). The correlation coefficient (R2), mean absolute error (MAE), and mean square error (MSE) were used as statistical indicators to assess the performance of the models. The results demonstrated that ANN and SVM are useful for estimating the Young’s modulus and elongation at break, with MSE values in the range of 0.64–1.0% and 0.14–0.28%, respectively. On the other hand, DT was more suitable for predicting the tensile strength, with the indicated error in the range of 0.02–9.11%. This study paves the way for the application of ML models as confident tools for predicting the mechanical properties of polymeric nanocomposites reinforced with different types of nanofiller, with a view to using them in practical applications such as biomedicine.

T1  - Comparison of McL-Poly(3-Hydroxyalkanoates) Synthesis by Different Pseudomonas Putida Strains From Crude Glycerol: Citrate Accumulates at High Titer Under PHA-producing Conditions
JO  - BMC Biotechnology
AB  - BackgroundAchieving a sustainable society requires, among other things, the use of renewable feedstocks to replace chemicals obtained from petroleum-derived compounds. Crude glycerol synthesized inexpensively as a byproduct of biodiesel production is currently considered a waste product, which can potentially be converted into value-added compounds by bacterial fermentation. This study aimed at evaluating several characterized P. putida strains to produce medium-chain-length poly(3-hydroxyalkanoates) (mcl-PHA) using raw glycerol as the only carbon/energy source.ResultsAmong all tested strains, P. putida KT2440 most efficiently synthesized mcl-PHA under nitrogen-limiting conditions, amassing more than 34% of its cell dry weight as PHA. Disruption of the PHA depolymerase gene (phaZ) in P. putida KT2440 enhanced the biopolymer titer up to 47% PHA (%wt/wt). The low biomass and PHA titer found in the mutant strain and the wild-type strain KT2440 seems to be triggered by the high production of the side-product citrate during the fermentation process which shows a high yield of 0.6 g/g.ConclusionsOverall, this work demonstrates the importance of choosing an appropriate microbe for the synthesis of mcl-PHA from waste materials, and a close inspection of the cell metabolism in order to identify undesired compounds that diminish the availability of precursors in the synthesis of biopolymers such as polyhydroxyalkanoates. Future metabolic engineering works should focus on reducing the production of citrate in order to modulate resource allocation in the cell’s metabolism of P. putida, and finally increase the biopolymer production.

T1  - Natural Fiber Reinforced Polylactic Acid Composites: A Review
JO  - Polymer Composites
AB  - Biopolymer‐based composites have attracted the attention of researchers and industries due to their eco‐friendliness and environmental sustainability, as well as their suitability for a number of applications. Biocomposites containing natural fibers and biopolymers would be the ideal choice in the development of biodegradable materials for different applications. Polylactic acid (PLA) is an environmentally interesting biopolymer, which also has exclusive qualities, such as good transparency and processability, glossy appearance, and high rigidity, although it has some shortcomings as well, for example, its brittleness and high rate of crystallization. PLA‐based natural fiber composites are entirely bio‐based materials with promising biodegradability and mechanical properties. Several research studies have been carried out on PLA and its composites to explore their potential to substitute petroleum‐based products, but until now there is no comprehensive review with up‐to‐date research data available in the literature. The aim of this review is to highlight the trends in the research and development of PLA and PLA‐based natural fiber composites over the past few years. This review article covers current research efforts on the synthesis and biodegradation of PLA, its properties, trends, challenges and prospects in the field of PLA and its composites. PLA‐based composites are moderately abundant; and further research and development is needed for cost reduction and broader utilization. POLYM.

T1  - A Systematic Survey of FDM Process Parameter Optimization and Their Influence on Part Characteristics
JO  - Journal of Manufacturing and Materials Processing
AB  - Fused deposition modeling (FDM) is an additive manufacturing (AM) process that is often used to fabricate geometrically complex shaped prototypes and parts. It is gaining popularity as it reduces cycle time for product development without the need for expensive tools. However, the commercialization of FDM technology in various industrial applications is currently limited due to several shortcomings, such as insufficient mechanical properties, poor surface quality, and low dimensional accuracy. The qualities of FDM-produced products are affected by various process parameters, for example, layer thickness, build orientation, raster width, or print speed. The setting of process parameters and their range depends on the section of FDM machines. Filament materials, nozzle dimensions, and the type of machine determine the range of various parameters. The optimum setting of parameters is deemed to improve the qualities of three-dimensional (3D) printed parts and may reduce post-production work. This paper intensively reviews state-of-the-art literature on the influence of parameters on part qualities and the existing work on process parameter optimization. Additionally, the shortcomings of existing works are identified, challenges and opportunities to work in this field are evaluated, and directions for future research in this field are suggested.

T1  - Effect of Plasticizers on the Physicochemical Properties of Bioplastic Extracted From Banana Peels
JO  - Journal of Institute of Science and Technology
AB  - Plasticizers are the binding substances used to increase the elasticity of materials. In this research work, bioplastic is extracted from banana peels using various plasticizers such as, glycerol, urea, distilled water and glucose. The prepared bioplastics were characterized by using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectroscopic analysis which showed that the peak at 3355 cm-1 indicate the H-bonding formation between N-H urea and starch. The physicochemical properties such as water absorption test, soil decomposition and load test of synthesized bioplastics were analyzed at ambient temperature. The water uptake analysis showed that bioplastic absorbs water for up to 4 days without being decay. The load test showed that urea plasticized bioplastic has a high tensile strength of 2.3 KPa. The result revealed that the bioplastic with glucose as a plasticizer showed the effective result in water uptake and soil decomposition test whereas the urea plasticized bioplastic showed relatively good tensile strength.

T1  - Review of Hybrid Materials Based on Polyhydroxyalkanoates for Tissue Engineering Applications
JO  - Polymers
AB  - This review is focused on hybrid polyhydroxyalkanoate-based (PHA) biomaterials with improved physico-mechanical, chemical, and piezoelectric properties and controlled biodegradation rate for applications in bone, cartilage, nerve and skin tissue engineering. PHAs are polyesters produced by a wide range of bacteria under unbalanced growth conditions. They are biodegradable, biocompatible, and piezoelectric polymers, which make them very attractive biomaterials for various biomedical applications. As naturally derived materials, PHAs have been used for multiple cell and tissue engineering applications; however, their widespread biomedical applications are limited due to their lack of toughness, elasticity, hydrophilicity and bioactivity. The chemical structure of PHAs allows them to combine with other polymers or inorganic materials to form hybrid composites with improved structural and functional properties. Their type (films, fibers, and 3D printed scaffolds) and properties can be tailored with fabrication methods and materials used as fillers. Here, we are aiming to fill in a gap in literature, revealing an up-to-date overview of ongoing research strategies that make use of PHAs as versatile and prospective biomaterials. In this work, a systematic and detailed review of works investigating PHA-based hybrid materials with tailored properties and performance for use in tissue engineering applications is carried out. A literature survey revealed that PHA-based composites have better performance for use in tissue regeneration applications than pure PHA.

T1  - Progress in Bio-Based Plastics and Plasticizing Modifications
JO  - Journal of Materials Chemistry A
AB  - Over the coming few decades bioplastic materials are expected to complement and gradually replace some of the fossil oil based materials. Multidisciplinary research efforts have generated a significant level of technical and commercial success towards these bio-based materials. However, extensive application of these bio-based plastics is still challenged by one or more of their possible inherent limitations, such as poor processability, brittleness, hydrophilicity, poor moisture and gas barrier, inferior compatibility, poor electrical, thermal and physical properties. The incorporation of additives such as plasticizers into the biopolymers is a common practice to improve these inherent limitations. Generally, plasticizers are added to both synthetic and bio-based polymeric materials to impart flexibility, improve toughness, and lower the glass transition temperature. This review introduces the most common bio-based plastics and provides an overview of recent advances in the selection and use of plasticizers, and their effect on the performance of these materials. In addition to plasticizers, we also present a perspective of other emerging techniques of improving the overall performance of bio-based plastics. Although a wide variety of bio-based plastics are under development, this review focuses on plasticizers utilized for the most extensively studied bioplastics including poly(lactic acid), polyhydroxyalkanoates, thermoplastic starch, proteinaceous plastics and cellulose acetates. The ongoing challenge and future potentials of plasticizers for bio-based plastics are also discussed.

T1  - Hybrid Bionanocomposites From Spent Hen Proteins
JO  - Acs Omega
AB  - Spent
hens, a poultry by-product, have little economic value for
processing and mostly end up in landfills. However, there are concerns
over disposal of spent hens; therefore, it is pertinent to find out
alternative uses that are environmentally sound. On the other hand,
single-use plastic packaging is leading to a global environmental
crisis. In this study, proteins were extracted from spent hen, plasticized,
and processed into films by compression molding. The hybrid bionanocomposite
films were successfully prepared using glycerol as a plasticizer,
chitosan as a cross-linker, and varying concentrations of nanoclay
as a nanoreinforcement. The effects of nanoreinforcements, plasticization,
and cross-linking were then evaluated on thermal, mechanical, and
barrier properties of the prepared bionanocomposite films. Various
concentrations of nanoclay and chitosan were dispersed in the protein
matrix. However, with the same plasticizer loading, the optimum addition
of chitosan and nanoclay led to almost twofold increase in the mechanical
strength, compared to neat protein films. The results indicated that
at optimal conditions, a good intercalation and/or exfoliation of
the protein biopolymers into clay interlayer galleries was observed
leading to improved thermal, thermomechanical, and barrier properties.
These hybrid bionanocomposite films have great future potential to
be used in packaging and other applications.

T1  - Chemical Recycling of Polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) Into Bio-Based Solvents and Their Use in a Circular PHB Extraction
JO  - Acs Sustainable Chemistry &Amp; Engineering
AB  - Two novel protocols
for the chemical valorization of polyhydroxybutyrate
(PHB) were developed, aiming at the production of two bio-based molecules:
methyl 3-hydroxybutyrate (MHB) and methyl 3-methoxybutyrate (MMB).
Optimized reaction conditions were applied to pure PHB and PHB inclusions
inside bacterial cells as starting materials. MHB was synthesized
through a single-step catalytic methanolysis, while MMB was synthesized
through a three-step process: thermolytic distillation to give crotonic
acid (CA), esterification to give methyl crotonate (MC), and oxa-Michael
addition of MeOH. The obtained MHB and MMB were tested as solvents
for the recovery of PHB itself both from freeze-dried single strain
cultures (SSC) and mixed microbial cultures (MMC) with low to medium
contents of PHB (22–57 wt %). High PHB recovery was achieved:
up to 96 ± 1% through MHB and up to 98 ± 1% through MMB.
Extraction from MMC slurry (with a PHB content of 39% on dry weight)
was also performed, recovering 77 ± 2% using MHB and 92 ±
2% using MMB. High purities and excellent molecular weights and polydispersity
indexes of extracted PHB were obtained with both MHB and MMB. Solubility
in water, octanol/water partition coefficients (log K
ow), and aerobic ready biodegradability of both solvents
were also evaluated.

T1  - Thermal Behavior and Kinetic of Degradation of PVA and PVA/CS/AL Blend
JO  - Sainteknol Jurnal Sains Dan Teknologi
AB  - Studying thermal behavior, especially regarding the kinetics of the degradation of materials has attracted attention in this recent years because it can provide information about the stability of materials in various conditions and how the mechanism of material degradation. In this research, the thermal behavior and kinetics of thermal degradation of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)/cassava starch (CS)/alkaline lignin (AL) with glycerol as a plasticizer were investigated and compared by the thermogravimetric analyzer. The test was carried out for samples under non-isothermal conditions in nitrogen at a single heating rate of 10 °C/min. The activation energies were calculated using Coats-Redfern, Broido, and Horowitz-Metzger methods. The results showed that PVA/0 and PVA/CS/AL had four decomposition steps with the main degradation of PVA/0 and PVA/CS/AL in the second and third decomposition steps. The first degradation of PVA/0 and PVA/CS/AL occurred at 125 °C - 270 °C with a decomposed mass of 35.94%, and 135 °C – 250 °C with a decomposed mass of 31.84%, respectively. The second degradation of PVA/0 and PVA/CS/AL was at  270 °C - 385 °C with a decomposed mass of 40.33%  and 250 °C – 395 °C with a decomposed mass of 38.62%. The values of activation energies using Coats-Redfern, Broido, and Horowitz  Metger methods of PVA/0 were 57.08 KJ/mol, 64.82 KJ/mol, and 70.57 KJ/mol, respectively. The values of activation energies using Coats-Redfern, Broido, and Horowitz  Metger methods of PVA/CS/AL were 74.49 KJ/mol, 82.17 KJ/mol, and 95.65 KJ/mol, respectively. The lower activation energy indicates that degradation reactions occur more easily. PVA/CS/AL has slightly better thermal stability than PVA/0.

T1  - Utilization of Breadfruit (Artocarpus Altilis) Peel Waste and Blood Clam Shell Waste (Anadara Granosa) as Raw Materials for Glycerol-Plasticized Degradable Bioplastic Production
JO  - Indonesian Journal of Biotechnology and Biodiversity
AB  - Nowadays, the world needs solutions to manage the ever-growing plastic waste problem. Plastics cannot decay easily in natural environment for example, PET took about 23 to 48 years to decay naturally in the environment. Therefore, it is urgently needed to find an alternative to these types of plastics, namely degradable plastics. One type of degradable plastic, called starch-based bioplastic can be made using starchy materials from Breadfruit peel. This, is in combination with Blood Clam shell – derived chitin nanowhiskers as reinforcer and glycerol as plasticizer. In this research, bioplastic is synthesized using starch extracted from Breadfruit (Artocarpus altilis) peel waste, reinforcing agent chitin nanowhisker (CNW) made from Blood Clam (Anadara granosa) shell waste, and glycerol as plasticizer. Furthermore, the plastic was tested according to general standard plastic tests including Tensile Strength, Water Uptake and Soil Burial test. Soil burial test results showed that in the period of less than 15 days, the bioplastic was completely decomposed. Water uptake test results showed that the bioplastic made from breadfruit peel starch and Blood Cam-derived CNW achieved water uptake numbers as high as 94,077 %, Tensile strength test showed that the bioplastic made from breadfruit waste starch and Blood clam-derived CNW of 0.0994 MPa was almost two times stronger than bioplastic made without the addition CNW of 0.0587 MPa and was also stronger than conventional plastics.

T1  - Impact of Layer Structure on Physical Stability and Lipase Digestibility of Lipid Droplets Coated by Biopolymer Nanolaminated Coatings
JO  - Food Biophysics
AB  - The objective of this study was to investigate the influence of the structure of nanolaminated biopolymer coatings surrounding lipid droplets on their physical stability and in vitro digestibility by pancreatic lipase. Caseinate (Ca) was used as an amphoteric emulsifier, pectin (P) was used as an anionic polyelectrolyte, and chitosan (C) was used as a cationic polyelectrolyte. The electrostatic layer-by-layer deposition approach was used to prepare multilayer emulsions containing lipid droplets coated by: (1) the same coating composition but different layer order (Ca-P-C and Ca-C-P); (2) the same outer layer but different coating compositions (e.g., Ca-P, Ca-P-C-P, and Ca-C-P). The stability of the emulsions to pH changes (3 to 7) depended strongly on the order of biopolymers within the nanolaminated coatings and on the nature of the outer coating. The lipid droplets in all of the multilayer emulsions were largely digested by lipase within 30 min when monitored using an in vitro digestion model (pH-Stat). This information could be useful for the rational design of delivery systems for lipophilic bioactive compounds that need to be encapsulated within foods but released in the human body.

T1  - Conversion of Low-Quality Cotton to Bioplastics
JO  - Cellulose
AB  - AbstractThe use of eco-friendly bioplastics has become a viable solution to reduce the accumulation of petrochemical products in the biosphere and to decrease microplastic contamination. In this study, we used low-quality cotton fibers that lack textile applications to prepare bioplastics. We dissolved cotton fibers in N,N-dimethylacetamide/lithium chloride (DMAc/LiCl) solvent system and converted cellulose solutions to strong, transparent, and flexible films through casting, gelation, regeneration, plasticization, and hot-pressing. Films were characterized using different analytical techniques to evaluate their physicochemical and mechanical properties. Compared to raw cotton cellulose, regenerated and hot-pressed cellulose films showed amorphous structures and excellent tensile characteristics. The physical and mechanical properties of cellulose films, such as deformation recovery, flexibility, homogeneity, elongation, and surface roughness, were significantly improved by means of plasticization and hot-pressing. Because glycerol plasticization increased the surface hydrophilicity of the films, plasma-induced surface grafting of oleic acid imparted hydrophobicity to cellulose films. This study presents a new avenue for using low-quality cotton fibers that are usually sold at a discounted price to produce value-added bioproducts for different applications.

T1  - Criteria for Assessing Sustainability of Lignocellulosic Wastes: Applied to the Cellulose Nanofibril Packaging Production in the UK
JO  - Polymers
AB  - Extensive use of petrochemical plastic packaging leads to the greenhouse gas emission and contamination to soil and oceans, posing major threats to the ecosystem. The packaging needs, hence, are shifting to bioplastics with natural degradability. Lignocellulose, the biomass from forest and agriculture, can produce cellulose nanofibrils (CNF), a biodegradable material with acceptable functional properties, that can make packaging among other products. Compared to primary sources, CNF extracted from lignocellulosic wastes reduces the feedstock cost without causing an extension to agriculture and associated emissions. Most of these low value feedstocks go to alternative applications, making their use in CNF packaging competitive. To transfer the waste materials from current practices to the packaging production, it is imperative to assess their sustainability, encompassing environmental and economic impacts along with the feedstock physical and chemical properties. A combined overview of these criteria is absent in the literature. This study consolidates thirteen attributes, delineating sustainability of lignocellulosic wastes for commercial CNF packaging production. These criteria data are gathered for the UK waste streams, and transformed into a quantitative matrix, evaluating the waste feedstock sustainability for CNF packaging production. The presented approach can be adopted to decision scenarios in bioplastics packaging conversion and waste management.

T1  - Going Beyond Cellulose and Chitosan: Synthetic Biodegradable Membranes for Drinking Water, Wastewater, and Oil–Water Remediation
JO  - Acs Omega
AB  - Membrane technology
is an efficient way to purify water, but it
generates non-biodegradable biohazardous waste. This waste ends up
in landfills, incinerators, or  microplastics, threatening the environment.
To address this, research is being conducted to develop compostable
alternatives that are sustainable and ecofriendly. Bioplastics, which
are expected to capture 40% of the market share by 2030, represent
one such alternative. This review examines the feasibility of using
synthetic biodegradable materials beyond cellulose and chitosan for
water treatment, considering cost, carbon footprint, and stability
in mechanical, thermal, and chemical environments. Although biodegradable
membranes have the potential to close the recycling loop, challenges
such as brittleness and water stability limit their use in membrane
applications. The review suggests approaches to tackle these issues
and highlights recent advances in the field of biodegradable membranes
for water purification. The end-of-life perspective of these materials
is also discussed, as their recyclability and compostability are critical
factors in reducing the environmental impact of membrane technology.
This review underscores the need to develop sustainable  alternatives
to conventional membrane materials and suggests that biodegradable
membranes have great potential to address this challenge.

T1  - Effect of the Micronization of Pulp Fibers on the Properties of Green Composites
JO  - Molecules
AB  - Green composites, composed of bio-based matrices and natural fibers, are a sustainable alternative for composites based on conventional thermoplastics and glass fibers. In this work, micronized bleached Eucalyptus kraft pulp (BEKP) fibers were used as reinforcement in biopolymeric matrices, namely poly(lactic acid) (PLA) and poly(hydroxybutyrate) (PHB). The influence of the load and aspect ratio of the mechanically treated microfibers on the morphology, water uptake, melt flowability, and mechanical and thermal properties of the green composites were investigated. Increasing fiber loads raised the tensile and flexural moduli as well as the tensile strength of the composites, while decreasing their elongation at the break and melt flow rate. The reduced aspect ratio of the micronized fibers (in the range from 11.0 to 28.9) improved their embedment in the matrices, particularly for PHB, leading to superior mechanical performance and lower water uptake when compared with the composites with non-micronized pulp fibers. The overall results show that micronization is a simple and sustainable alternative for conventional chemical treatments in the manufacturing of entirely bio-based composites.

T1  - Extraction of Cellulose From Ulva Lactuca Algae and Its Use for Membrane Synthesis
JO  - Polymers
AB  - Green algae are a sustainable source of biopolymers for the global demand due to their high photosynthetic efficiency. This article describes the extraction of cellulose from plant systems represented by Ulva lactuca species. In order to extract various substances, algae were finely ground with the help of solvents (liquid media). This was carried out to achieve the necessary conditions that help reduce the resistance this phase shows in regard to the transport and transfer of the species being extracted. The highest yield of extracted cellulose (20,944%) was obtained for the following factors: S/L = 1/20; conc. ethanol = 90%, conc. salts = 4 g/L. Hydrogel membranes are a unique class of macromolecular networks that contain a large fraction of aqueous solvent within their structure. With the cellulose extracted from algae, we obtained membranes which underwent the process of swelling in liquid media (ethyl alcohol) of different concentrations. The swelling of biocellulose membranes in alcoholic solutions of high concentrations was investigated. It was observed that the process of absorption of the alcoholic solution by the membrane occurred rapidly in the first part. After stabilization, the membranes continued to absorb at a slower rate until stabilization or saturation concentration was reached.

T1  - Agri-Food Wastes for Bioplastics: European Prospective on Possible Applications in Their Second Life for a Circular Economy
JO  - Polymers
AB  - Agri-food wastes (such as brewer’s spent grain, olive pomace, residual pulp from fruit juice production, etc.) are produced annually in very high quantities posing a serious problem, both environmentally and economically. These wastes can be used as secondary starting materials to produce value-added goods within the principles of the circular economy. In this context, this review focuses on the use of agri-food wastes either to produce building blocks for bioplastics manufacturing or biofillers to be mixed with other bioplastics. The pros and cons of the literature analysis have been highlighted, together with the main aspects related to the production of bioplastics, their use and recycling. The high number of European Union (EU)-funded projects for the valorisation of agri-food waste with the best European practices for this industrial sector confirm a growing interest in safeguarding our planet from environmental pollution. However, problems such as the correct labelling and separation of bioplastics from fossil ones remain open and to be optimised, with the possibility of reuse before final composting and selective recovery of biomass.

T1  - Recycling of Bioplastics: Routes and Benefits
JO  - Journal of Polymers and the Environment
AB  - Continual reduction of landfill space along with rising CO 2 levels and environmental pollution, are global issues that will only grow with time if not correctly addressed. The lack of proper waste management infrastructure means gloablly commodity plastics are disposed of incorrectly, leading to both an economical loss and environmental destruction. The bioaccumulation of plastics and microplastics can already be seen in marine ecosystems causing a negative impact on all organisms that live there, ultimately microplastics will bioaccumulate in humans. The opportunity exists to replace the majority of petroleum derived plastics with bioplastics (bio-based, biodegradable or both). This, in conjunction with mechanical and chemical recycling is a renewable and sustainable solution that would help mitigate climate change. This review covers the most promising biopolymers PLA, PGA, PHA and bio-versions of conventional petro-plastics bio-PET, bio-PE. The most optimal recycling routes after reuse and mechanical recycling are: alcoholysis, biodegradation, biological recycling, glycolysis and pyrolysis respectively.

T1  - Biochemical and Structural Insights Into Enzymatic Depolymerization of Polylactic Acid and Other Polyesters by Microbial Carboxylesterases
JO  - Biomacromolecules
AB  - Polylactic acid (PLA) is a biodegradable polyester derived from renewable resources, which is a leading candidate for the replacement of traditional petroleum-based polymers. Since the global production of PLA is quickly growing, there is an urgent need for the development of efficient recycling technologies, which will produce lactic acid instead of CO2 as the final product. After screening 90 purified microbial α/β-hydrolases, we identified hydrolytic activity against emulsified PLA in two uncharacterized proteins, ABO2449 from Alcanivorax borkumensis and RPA1511 from Rhodopseudomonas palustris. Both enzymes were also active against emulsified polycaprolactone and other polyesters as well as against soluble α-naphthyl and p-nitrophenyl monoesters. In addition, both ABO2449 and RPA1511 catalyzed complete or extensive hydrolysis of solid PLA with the production of lactic acid monomers, dimers, and larger oligomers as products. The crystal structure of RPA1511 was determined at 2.2 Å resolution and revealed a classical α/β-hydrolase fold with a wide-open active site containing a molecule of polyethylene glycol bound near the catalytic triad Ser114-His270-Asp242. Site-directed mutagenesis of both proteins demonstrated that the catalytic triad residues are important for the hydrolysis of both monoester and polyester substrates. We also identified several residues in RPA1511 (Gln172, Leu212, Met215, Trp218, and Leu220) and ABO2449 (Phe38 and Leu152), which were not essential for activity against soluble monoesters but were found to be critical for the hydrolysis of PLA. Our results indicate that microbial carboxyl esterases can efficiently hydrolyze various polyesters making them attractive biocatalysts for plastics depolymerization and recycling.

T1  - Degradation of Bio-Based and Biodegradable Plastic and Its Contribution to Soil Organic Carbon Stock
JO  - Polymers
AB  - Expanding the use of environmentally friendly materials to protect the environment is one of the key factors in maintaining a sustainable ecological balance. Poly(butylene succinate-co-adipate) (PBSA) is considered among the most promising bio-based and biodegradable plastics for the future with a high number of applications in soil and agriculture. Therefore, the decomposition process of PBSA and its consequences for the carbon stored in soil require careful monitoring. For the first time, the stable isotope technique was applied in the current study to partitioning plastic- and soil-originated C in the CO2 released during 80 days of PBSA decomposition in a Haplic Chernozem soil as dependent on nitrogen availability. The decomposition of the plastic was accompanied by the C loss from soil organic matter (SOM) through priming, which in turn was dependent on added N. Nitrogen facilitated PBSA decomposition and reduced the priming effect during the first 6 weeks of the experiment. During the 80 days of plastic decomposition, 30% and 49% of the released CO2 were PBSA-derived, while the amount of SOM-derived CO2 exceeded the corresponding controls by 100.2 and 132.3% in PBSA-amended soil without and with N fertilization, respectively. Finally, only 4.1% and 5.4% of the PBSA added into the soil was mineralized to CO2, in the treatments without and with N amendment, respectively.

T1  - Screening of Chaetomorpha Linum Lipidic Extract as a New Potential Source of Bioactive Compounds
JO  - Marine Drugs
AB  - Recent studies have shown that marine algae represent a great source of natural compounds with several properties. The lipidic extract of the seaweed Chaetomorpha linum (Chlorophyta, Cladophorales), one of the dominant species in the Mar Piccolo of Taranto (Mediterranean, Ionian Sea), revealed an antibacterial activity against Vibrio ordalii and Vibrio vulnificus, common pathogens in aquaculture, suggesting its potential employment to control fish and shellfish diseases due to vibriosis and to reduce the public health hazards related to antibiotic use in aquaculture. This extract showed also an antioxidant activity, corresponding to 170.960 ± 16. mmol Trolox equivalent/g (oxygen radical absorbance capacity assay—ORAC) and to 30.554 ± 2.30 mmol Trolox equivalent/g (Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity assay—TEAC). The chemical characterization of the extract, performed by 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy, highlighted the presence of free, saturated (SAFAs), unsaturated (UFAs) and polyunsaturated (PUFAs) fatty acids. The high content of ω-6 and ω-3 PUFAs confirmed also by gas chromatography indicates the potentiality of this algal species in the production of fortified food. The antibacterial activity seems related to the presence of linolenic acid present at high density, while the antioxidant activity could be likely ascribable to molecules such as carotenoids and chlorophylls (characterized also by thin-layer chromatography), known for this property. The presence of polyhydroxybutyrate, a biopolymer with potentiality in the field of biodegradable bioplastics was also detected. The exploitation of C. linum for a future biotechnological application is also encouraged by the results from a first attempt of cultivating this species in an integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA) system.

T1  - 3D Printed Piezoelectric BaTiO3/Polyhydroxybutyrate Nanocomposite Scaffolds for Bone Tissue Engineering
JO  - Bioengineering
AB  - Bone defects are a significant health problem worldwide. Novel treatment approaches in the tissue engineering field rely on the use of biomaterial scaffolds to stimulate and guide the regeneration of damaged tissue that cannot repair or regrow spontaneously. This work aimed at developing and characterizing new piezoelectric scaffolds to provide electric bio-signals naturally present in bone and vascular tissues. Mixing and extrusion were used to obtain nanocomposites made of polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) as a matrix and barium titanate (BaTiO3) nanoparticles as a filler, at BaTiO3/PHB compositions of 5/95, 10/90, 15/85 and 20/80 (w/w%). The morphological, thermal, mechanical and piezoelectric properties of the nanocomposites were studied. Scanning electron microscopy analysis showed good nanoparticle dispersion within the polymer matrix. Considerable increases in the Young’s modulus, compressive strength and the piezoelectric coefficient d31 were observed with increasing BaTiO3 content, with d31 = 37 pm/V in 20/80 (w/w%) BaTiO3/PHB. 3D printing was used to produce porous cubic-shaped scaffolds using a 90° lay-down pattern, with pore size ranging in 0.60–0.77 mm and good mechanical stability. Biodegradation tests conducted for 8 weeks in saline solution at 37 °C showed low mass loss (∼4%) for 3D printed scaffolds. The results obtained in terms of piezoelectric, mechanical and chemical properties of the nanocomposite provide a new promising strategy for vascularized bone tissue engineering.

T1  - Renewable Biobased Polymeric Materials: Facile Synthesis of Itaconic Anhydride-Based Copolymers With Poly(l-Lactic Acid) Grafts
JO  - Macromolecules
AB  - This paper reports a new synthesis of biobased polymers
by using
itaconic anhydride (IAn) and lactic acid (LA) as renewable starting
materials. Poly(lactic acid) (PLA)-graft copolymers were synthesized
via two approaches. First, the macromonomer approach utilized IAn
for Sn-catalyzed synthesis of PLA-containing macromonomers (IAn-PLA
Macro). The macromonomer was radically copolymerized with n-butyl methacrylate (BMA), n-butyl acrylate
(BA), methyl methacrylate (MMA), and ethyl methacrylate (EMA) to give
efficiently graft copolymers (PLA-Graft copolymer (I))
with molecular weight M
n up to 1.61 ×
105 having biomass content higher than 34 wt %. Second,
the copolymer approach employed first IAn as comonomer for radical
copolymerization with BMA, giving rise to IAn-BMA copolymer with M
n higher than 5.76 × 104. Then,
Sn-catalyzed grafting of PLA onto IAn moiety of the copolymer produced
PLA-Graft copolymer (II) with M
n higher than 5.88 × 104, showing biomass content
≥29 wt %. In addition, radical homopolymerization of IAn was
examined to give polyIAn. By using these two approaches employing
IAn as a starting reactive material, PLA-graft copolymers were obtained
as “biomass-plastics”. Properties of PLA-Graft copolymers
(I) were also examined, which revealed possible applications
for coatings and plastics. Furthermore, the IAn-containing graft copolymers
will be a convenient starting biomass polymer having reactive IAn
moiety in the main chain for further grafting or various functional
group-introducing reactions.

T1  - Using Life Cycle Assessment to Quantify the Environmental Benefit of Upcycling Vine Shoots as Fillers in Biocomposite Packaging Materials
JO  - The International Journal of Life Cycle Assessment
AB  - Abstract

Purpose
The objective of the present study was to better understand the potential environmental benefit of using vine shoots (ViShs), an agricultural residue, as filler in composite materials. For that purpose, a comparative life cycle assessment (LCA) of a rigid tray made of virgin poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) PHBV, polylactic acid (PLA) or polypropylene (PP), and increasing content of ViSh particles was performed. The contribution of each processing step in the life cycle on the different environmental impacts was identified and discussed. Furthermore, the balance between the environmental and the economic benefits of composite trays was discussed.


Methods
This work presents a cradle-to-grave LCA of composite rigid trays. Once collected in vineyards, ViShs were dried and ground using dry fractionation processes, then mixed with a polymer matrix by melt extrusion to produce compounds that were finally injected to obtain rigid trays for food packaging. The density of each component was taken into account in order to compare trays with the same volume. The maximum filler content was set to 30 vol% according to recommendations from literature and industrial data. The ReCiPe 2016 Midpoint Hierarchist (H) methodology was used for the assessment using the cutoff system model.


Results and discussion
This study showed that bioplastics are currently less eco-friendly than PP. This is in part due to the fact that LCA does not account for, in existing tools, effects of microplastic accumulation and that bioplastic technologies are still under development with low tonnage. This study also demonstrated the environmental interest of the development of biocomposites by the incorporation of ViSh particles. The minimal filler content of interest depended on the matrices and the impact categories. Concerning global warming, composite trays had less impact than virgin plastic trays from 5 vol% for PHBV or PLA and from 20 vol% for PP. Concerning PHBV, the only biodegradable polymer in natural conditions in this study, the price and the impact on global warming are reduced by 25% and 20% respectively when 30 vol% of ViSh are added.


Conclusion
The benefit of using vine shoots in composite materials from an environmental and economical point of view was demonstrated. As a recommendation, the polymer production step, which constitutes the most important impact, should be optimized and the maximum filler content in composite materials should be increased.

T1  - Starch-Based Rehealable and Degradable Bioplastic Enabled by Dynamic Imine Chemistry
JO  - Acs Sustainable Chemistry &Amp; Engineering
AB  - The increasingly serious environmental pollution caused by petroleum-based nondegradable plastics has evoked intense research interest in the development of sustainable and degradable bioplastics. Starch is one of the most promising biopolymers for the preparation of bioplastic. However, it is still a great challenge to develop starch bioplastics with high strength, low water sensitivity, and excellent water resistance. Herein, we reported a facile chemical modification method for the synthesis of a novel starch bioplastic. In this process, an easily available starch derivate, dialdehyde starch (DAS), is cross-linked using diamine based on dynamic imine chemistry to prepare DAS-based polyimine (DAS-PI). This DAS-PI exhibits excellent thermal malleability, and it can be easily thermoformed into novel starch bioplastic without using any plasticizer. The resulting starch bioplastic shows high mechanical strength (40.6 MPa), high thermal stability, and excellent water/chemical resistance, as well as heat-induced self-healing ability. Moreover, it can be easily chemically degraded and recycled. This work provides a novel method of producing high-performance starch bioplastics without using plasticizers.

T1  - Bioplastics for a Circular Economy
JO  - Nature Reviews Materials
AB  - Bioplastics — typically plastics manufactured from bio-based polymers — stand to contribute to more sustainable commercial plastic life cycles as part of a circular economy, in which virgin polymers are made from renewable or recycled raw materials. Carbon-neutral energy is used for production and products are reused or recycled at their end of life (EOL). In this Review, we assess the advantages and challenges of bioplastics in transitioning towards a circular economy. Compared with fossil-based plastics, bio-based plastics can have a lower carbon footprint and exhibit advantageous materials properties; moreover, they can be compatible with existing recycling streams and some offer biodegradation as an EOL scenario if performed in controlled or predictable environments. However, these benefits can have trade-offs, including negative agricultural impacts, competition with food production, unclear EOL management and higher costs. Emerging chemical and biological methods can enable the ‘upcycling’ of increasing volumes of heterogeneous plastic and bioplastic waste into higher-quality materials. To guide converters and consumers in their purchasing choices, existing (bio)plastic identification standards and life cycle assessment guidelines need revision and homogenization. Furthermore, clear regulation and financial incentives remain essential to scale from niche polymers to large-scale bioplastic market applications with truly sustainable impact.

T1  - Biopolymer Compositions Based on Poly(3-Hydroxybutyrate) and Linear Polyurethanes With Aromatic Rings—Preparation and Properties Evaluation
JO  - Polymers
AB  - Polymer biocompositions of poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (P3HB) and linear polyurethanes (PU) with aromatic rings were produced by melt-blending at different P3HB/PU weight ratios (100/0, 95/5, 90/10, and 85/15). Polyurethanes have been prepared with 4,4′-diphenylmethane diisocyanate and polyethylene glycols with molar masses of 400 g/mol (PU400), 1000g/mol (PU1000), and 1500 g/mol (PU1500). The compatibility and morphology of the obtained polymer blends were determined by infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The effect of the polyurethane content in the biocompositions on their thermal stability and mechanical properties was investigated and compared with those of the native P3HB. It was shown that increasing the PU content in P3HB-PU compositions to 10 wt.% leads to an improvement in the mentioned properties. The obtained results demonstrated that the thermal stability and mechanical properties of P3HB were improved, particularly in terms of increasing the degradation temperature, reducing hardness, and increasing impact strength. The best thermal and mechanical properties were shown by the P3HB-PU polymer compositions containing 10 wt.% of polyurethane modifiers, especially PU1000, which was also confirmed by the morphology analysis of these biocompositions. The presence of polyurethanes in the resulting polymer biocomposites decreases their glass transition temperatures, i.e., makes the materials more flexible. The resulting polymer biocompositions have suitable mechanical properties and thermal properties within the processing conditions for the predicted application as biodegradable, short-lived products for agriculture.

T1  - Polyhydroxyalkanoate Production on Waste Water Treatment Plants: Process Scheme, Operating Conditions and Potential Analysis for German and European Municipal Waste Water Treatment Plants
JO  - Bioengineering
AB  - This work describes the production of polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) as a side stream process on a municipal waste water treatment plant (WWTP) and a subsequent analysis of the production potential in Germany and the European Union (EU). Therefore, tests with different types of sludge from a WWTP were investigated regarding their volatile fatty acids (VFA) production-potential. Afterwards, primary sludge was used as substrate to test a series of operating conditions (temperature, pH, retention time (RT) and withdrawal (WD)) in order to find suitable settings for a high and stable VFA production. In a second step, various tests regarding a high PHA production and stable PHA composition to determine the influence of substrate concentration, temperature, pH and cycle time of an installed feast/famine-regime were conducted. Experiments with a semi-continuous reactor operation showed that a short RT of 4 days and a small WD of 25% at pH = 6 and around 30 °C is preferable for a high VFA production rate (PR) of 1913 mgVFA/(L×d) and a stable VFA composition. A high PHA production up to 28.4% of cell dry weight (CDW) was reached at lower substrate concentration, 20 °C, neutral pH-value and a 24 h cycle time. A final step a potential analysis, based on the results and detailed data from German waste water treatment plants, showed that the theoretically possible production of biopolymers in Germany amounts to more than 19% of the 2016 worldwide biopolymer production. In addition, a profound estimation regarding the EU showed that in theory about 120% of the worldwide biopolymer production (in 2016) could be produced on European waste water treatment plants.

T1  - Performance and Biodegradation in Soil of Novel Horticulture Containers Made From Bioplastics and Biocomposites
JO  - Horttechnology
AB  - The container-crops industry relies heavily on single-use plant containers made from petroleum-based plastics, most of which contribute to the solid waste stream in landfills. Plant containers made from biorenewable materials have potential to be more sustainable, but most commercially available biocontainers are either not durable enough for common production cycles or do not effectively biodegrade in soil after use. In 2012 and 2013, we evaluated 28 novel biocontainers (injection-molded prototypes) for their performance during plant production and their biodegradation in soil at two sites with dissimilar soil and climate in Iowa and Nevada, and we compared their performance to that of commercially available biocontainers. Prototype containers made of blends or composites of polylactic acid (PLA) or polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) performed well during crop production, and many showed an effective rate of biodegradation in soil. Their rates of biodegradation in Nevada were either similar or lower than they were in Iowa, but the highest rated containers were acceptable for use in both locations. Adding biobased fibers of distiller’s dried grains with solubles or corn stover to form composite materials improved biodegradation over that of the base polymers (PLA or PHA) and had little effect on container performance under greenhouse conditions. Many of the injection-molded prototypes performed as well as the petroleum control containers during crop production, yet biodegraded at similar or faster rates than commercially available fiber containers.

T1  - Optimization Using Central Composite Design (CCD) on Cellulose Acetate/Polyethylene Glycol Composite Beads for Adsorption of Methylene Blue in Batch System
JO  - Advances in Science and Technology
AB  - Textile dyes waste can cause a big problem for the environment. Adsorption is a simple approach in treatment of textile dyes waste. On the other hand, the use of disposable adsorbents also creates production cost problems because they are less economic. Currently, research on adsorbents is forwarded to the use of biopolymers such as chitosan, chitin, and cellulose. This research studied the use of cellulose beads, made from cellulose acetate (CA) blended with polyethylene glycol 200 (PEG200), as adsorbent in removing cationic dye of methylene blue (MB). Adsorption performance of cellulose beads was evaluated and optimized under variation of adsorption conditions (pH, beads dose, dye concentration) and PEG200 content. Optimization was carried out by using response surface methodology (RSM) with a face-centered central composite design (FCCD) model. The results showed that the optimum condition was obtained at pH of 7, beads dose of 2 g/L, dye concentration of 20 mg/L for bead composition of CA/PEG200 (90/10). The optimum % dye removal predicted by the design model was 52.4706 %.

T1  - Bacterial Nanocellulose Production and Application: A 10-Year Overview
JO  - Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology
AB  - Production of bacterial nanocellulose (BNC) is becoming increasingly popular owing to its environmentally friendly properties. Based on this benefit of BNC production, researchers have also begun to examine the capacity for cellulose production through microbial hosts. Indeed, several research groups have developed processes for BNC production, and many studies have been published to date, with the goal of developing methods for large-scale production. During BNC bioproduction, the culture medium represents approximately 30 % of the total cost. Therefore, one important and challenging aspect of the fermentation process is identification of a new cost-effective culture medium that can facilitate the production of high yields within short periods of time, thereby improving BNC production and permitting application of BNC in the biotechnological, medical, pharmaceutical, and food industries. In this review, we addressed different aspects of BNC production, including types of fermentation processes and culture media, with the aim of demonstrating the importance of these parameters.

T1  - Bioplastic Design Using Multitask Deep Neural Networks
JO  - Communications Materials
AB  - AbstractNon-degradable plastic waste jeopardizes our environment, yet our modern lifestyle and current technologies are impossible to sustain without plastics. Bio-synthesized and biodegradable alternatives such as polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) have the potential to replace large portions of the world’s plastic supply with cradle-to-cradle materials, but their chemical complexity and diversity limit traditional resource-intensive experimentation. Here, we develop multitask deep neural network property predictors using available experimental data for a diverse set of nearly 23,000 homo- and copolymer chemistries. Using the predictors, we identify 14 PHA-based bioplastics from a search space of almost 1.4 million candidates which could serve as potential replacements for seven petroleum-based commodity plastics that account for 75% of the world’s yearly plastic production. We also discuss possible synthesis routes for the identified promising materials.

T1  - Systematic Evidence Mapping to Assess the Sustainability of Bioplastics Derived From Food Waste: Do We Know Enough?
JO  - Sustainability
AB  - The production of bioplastics from food loss and waste (FLW), termed FLW-derived bioplastics, is considered an attractive alternative to first-generation bioplastics. To our knowledge, a clear understanding of the sustainability performance of FLW-derived bioplastics from environmental, economic, technical, and social aspects is still lacking. This systematic evidence mapping aims to fill this gap by undertaking a reality check on the life cycle sustainability performance of FLW-derived bioplastics from a multidimensional perspective underpinned by systems thinking approach to assess their potential to revolutionise the plastics economy. Results revealed that FLW-derived bioplastic production is highly complex and uncertain. The low technological readiness of FLW valorisation processes and the under-researched logistics of FLW management on a regional scale currently withhold advancement in this field. Nonetheless, progress is looming, and ensuring that FLW-derived bioplastics production enables the transition toward a sustainable bioeconomy is critical. Innovation in both the food and plastics value chains is urgently needed to address their challenges and mitigate pollution. Yet, any steps forward need to be holistically calculated to yield sustainability benefits and prevent unintended consequences.

T1  - Brewery Spent Grain: A Potential Biosorbent for Hexavalent Chromium
JO  - Journal of the Institute of Brewing
AB  - Spent grain is a solid waste from the brewery process which is used as feed for ruminants or as organic fertiliser. Due to the large scale generation of spent grain, new technological and industrial applications are being developed. In this work, spent grain was modified by chemical treatments for use in the biosorption of hexavalent chromium. For spent grain treated with acid, alkali, petroleum ether and hydrogen peroxide, the amount of hexavalent chromium removed was respectively 97, 21, 0.9 and 0.5%. The kinetic data of spent grain biosorbent treated with acid, untreated and treated with alkali were applied to pseudo‐first order, pseudo‐second order and intraparticle diffusion models. The pseudo‐second order model showed the best fit to the kinetic data, indicating chemisorption in the biosorption processes. The effects of pH and biosorbent concentration were analysed for spent grain treated with acid. The optimum values for pH and concentration of the biosorbent were pH 2 and 2 g/L.

T1  - Coagulation of Humic Waters for Diffused Pollution Control and the Influence of Coagulant Type on DOC Fractions Removed
JO  - Journal of Environmental Management
AB  - This study examined the suitability of organic coagulants for treatment of typically humic peat extraction runoff water by comparing their performance with that of ferric sulphate (FS). The influence of coagulant type on dissolved organic carbon (DOC) fractions removed was analysed in detail using LC-OCD-OND (size exclusion liquid chromatography coupled with organic carbon and organic nitrogen detection) fractionation techniques. In general, lower coagulant dosage was needed under acidic (pH 4.5) than neutral (pH 6.5) conditions. Chitosan (Chit) and poly(diallyldimethyl) ammonium chloride (pDMAC) required significantly lower dosage (40-55%) than FS for acceptable purification, while a tannin-based coagulant (Tan2) required substantially higher dosage (55-75%) independent of water pH. FS demonstrated the best removal of DOC (&lt;81%) and phosphorus (&lt;93%) followed by pDMAC, while Chit and Tan2 achieved the highest removal of suspended solids (SS) (&lt;58%), with flocs formed by Tan2 presenting the best settling properties. Higher molecular weight (MW) DOC fractions were more efficiently removed by all coagulants, with FS being the most efficient (biopolymers 69% and humic substances 91%), followed by Tan2. FS also displayed satisfactory removal of lower MW fractions (building blocks ~46% and low MW neutrals 62%). Overall, FS was the best performing coagulant.Nevertheless, the organic polymers demonstrated satisfactory overall performance, achieving purification rates mostly inside the requirements set by Finnish environmental authorities.

T1  - Bacterial Nanocellulose Loaded With Bromelain: Assessment of Antimicrobial, Antioxidant and Physical-Chemical Properties
JO  - Scientific Reports
AB  - Bacterial nanocellulose (BNC) has desirable properties for wound healing such as high purity, good shape retention, and high water binding capacity. Bromelain is a protease found in pineapple tissues and has been applied in several fields, it has anti-inflammatory and anticancer properties, promotes cell apoptosis, amongst others. In this work, a BNC based device for the controlled release of bromelain was developed. BNC were submersed in sterilized bromelain solution and incubated at 25 °C under 100 rpm for 24 h. Physical-chemical properties, protein concentration, antioxidant and antimicrobial activities were measured. Results demonstrate that BNC could improve bromelain antimicrobial activity 9 times. Those findings allow concluding that bromelain is a promising molecule to be incorporated into BNC’s. The BNC’s characteristics seem to represent a new promising delivery system of the loaded biomolecule, and protected from external actions.

T1  - Bioplastics – An Eco-Friendly Alternative to Petrochemical Plastics
JO  - Current World Environment
AB  - Plastics have varied application and have become an essential part of our daily lives. The use of the plastics has increased twenty-fold in the past half-century and is expected to double again in the next 20 years. As a global estimate, around 330 million tonnes of the plastics are produced per annum. The production, use and disposal of the plastics emerged as a persistent and potential environmental nuisance. The improper disposal of the plastics ends up in our environment, resulting in the deaths of millions of animals annually and also the reduction in fertility status of the soil. The bioplastics products are manufactured to be biodegradable with similar functionality to that of conventional plastics, which has the potential to reduce the dependence on petrochemicals based plastics and related environmental problems. The expansion and development of the bioplastics and their products would lead to the increase in the sustainability of environment and reduction in the emission of greenhouse gases. The bioplastics innovation would be a key to the long-term solution for the plastic pollution. However, a widespread public awareness is also essential in effecting longer-term change against plastic pollution.

T1  - Abiotic and Biotic Environmental Degradation of the Bioplastic Polymer Poly(lactic Acid): A Review
JO  - Polymer Degradation and Stability
AB  - Poly(lactic acid) (PLA) is a compostable bioplastic manufactured by the polymerization of lactic acid monomers derived from the fermentation of starch as a feedstock. Since its first commercialisation in the late 1990's, PLA production has grown annually and currently it estimated that worldwide production will reach at least 800,000 tons by 2020 with Japan and the USA the two major producers. PLA is used as a replacement to conventional petrochemical based plastics, principally as food packaging containers and films and more recently, in electronics and in the manufacture of synthetic fibres. Consequently, there has been a marked increase in PLA contamination in the environment as well as increasing amounts being diverted to commercial composting facilities. This review focuses on the development, production, stability and degradation of PLA in a range of differing environments and explores our current knowledge of the environmental and biological factors involved in PLA degradation.

T1  - Environmental Properties of Coconut Fiber/Reinforced Thermoplastic Starch/Beeswax Hybrid Composites
JO  - Pertanika Journal of Science and Technology
AB  - The creation of degradable biocomposites is anticipated to alleviate the challenges of worldwide environmental contamination and resource exhaustion. The study investigates the effect of coconut fiber on the environmental properties and water affinity behavior of thermoplastic starch/beeswax composite. The biocomposites were fabricated by incorporating the coconut husk fiber range from 10 to 50 wt%. The thermoplastic starch contains cassava starch, glycerol, and beeswax. The modification of the mixture became efficient when the mixing was determined to be stronger when used as a high-pace blender to aid the mixing process. The mixture then underwent a hot compression molding method to form the mixture into the desired sample form. We can conclude from the results that samples with high fiber content absorb less water than those with no fiber content. For moisture absorption, when the fiber content increases, the ability of the fiber to moisture absorption is decreased. The thickness swelling results show that the sample shows less swelling as the fiber percentage increases. For the soil burial test, incorporating 50 wt% coconut fiber decreases the weight reduction for 4 weeks. For the water solubility test, the solubility of 50 wt% is the best. Based on the findings, integrating coconut fiber into the modified thermoplastic cassava starch increases the composite properties relative to the non-reinforcement matrix material starch.

T1  - Synthesis and Characterization of Eco-Friendly Bioplastic From Low-Cost Plant Resources
JO  - Sn Applied Sciences
AB  - Alarming rate of environmental pollution caused by single-use plastics has necessitated the search for developing sustainable yet, cost-effective alternatives. This study aimed to develop bioplastic films using combination of jackfruit waste flour and sago as a low-cost starch source. Three composite bioplastic films were developed using starch mix with lemon extract and water but with different cross-linkers: (1) PV (polylactic acid and crude palm oil), (2) AV (glycerol and crude palm oil), (3) PAV (polylactic acid, glycerol and crude palm oil). The formulated films' physical, chemical, mechanical and biological parameters were characterized. PV film showed the best tensile strength (TS) of 5.24 MPa and least elongation at break (EAB) of 3.49%, while PAV film had the least TS of 0.78 MPa with a maximum EAB (73.38%). FTIR analysis of films showed peak at 1736.3-1743.3 cm −1 indicating strong interaction of triglycerides (C=O stretching). In thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), all the films displayed gradual desorption occurring between 150 and 220 °C where the volatile compounds started to evaporate and around 300 °C the lower molecular weight compounds like plasticizer, cross-linker and other additives started to release out; pyrolysis of carbonated compounds occurred above 500 °C. PAV film displayed best thermal stability with half decomposition at 330 °C. Biodegradability of films was demonstrated through soil burial method and culturing of pure cultures of microorganisms in minimal media by providing the film as carbon source. Bioplastic films developed in this study using low-cost plant starch sources have displayed properties with potential application in food packaging industry.

T1  - Effect of Low Concentration of SiO2 Nanoparticles on Grape Seed Essential Oil/Pbat Composite Films for Sustainable Food Packaging Application
JO  - Sustainability
AB  - Active packaging material has been used in the food industry to maintain the quality of packaged foods. The use of conventional polymers has serious environmental consequences due to improper disposal or recycling methods. Therefore, active packaging films based on biopolymers have been developed due to their excellent biocompatibility, degradability, and eco-friendliness. Amongst all essential oils, grape seed oil is considered to be a promising antimicrobial agent. It comprises large quantities of flavonoids, tocopherols, and other antimicrobial compounds. Grape seed essential oil has good antimicrobial and antioxidant activity. As a film, it is used to preserve food items such as poultry products, fish, and tomatoes. This work aimed to develop a polybutylene adipate terephthalate (PBAT) biocomposite film incorporated with natural grape seed essential oil (GEO) in addition to silica nanoparticles (SiO2 NPs) using the solution casting process. To achieve the desired packaging properties of the prepared PBAT-based film, the concentrations of grape seed essential oil as a plasticizer and nanosilica as a filler material were varied. The optical, physical, barrier, mechanical, surface hydrophobicity, and antibacterial properties of the PBAT/GEO/SiO2NP films were assessed. The FT-IR and XRD results indicated that GEO had effective miscibility with the PBAT/SiO2NP matrix. The addition of GEO increased the film flexibility, opacity, and antimicrobial activity, but the incorporation of SiO2NPs in the PBAT/GEO blend increased the tensile strength, thermal stability, and antimicrobial activities. The PBAT/GEO/SiO2NP films exhibited excellent antibacterial activity against food spoilage microorganisms. Finally, due to improved antimicrobial activities, film flexibility, optical, and heat resistance properties, the PBAT/GEO/NP nanocomposite films were found to have high potential for usage in active food packaging applications.

) Starch Film Prepared Using Three Different Methods
JO  - Starch - Stärke
AB  - The objective of this work is to study the physical and tensile properties of jicama (Pachyrhizus erosus) starch film prepared using three different methods. First, a film is prepared from starch granules after sifting using a sieve shaker. A second film is prepared from starch granules after ultrasonication. Another film is made by sonicating the starch gel. Ultrasonication is performed using an ultrasonic probe. These three different methods have a significant effect on the properties of the film (p ≤ 0.05). The film from the starch granules after sifting using 63 μm mesh size and ultrasonication (labeled as S‐63U film) shows the optimum properties. Opacity for S‐63U film is almost half (48.6%) that of the equivalent non‐sonicated film. S‐63U film has the highest tensile strength (3.1 MPa), the lowest moisture absorption (18% after 8 h in a humid chamber) and water vapor permeability. FESEM morphology of the fracture surface of the sonicated film display a more homogeneous structure compared to films without ultrasonication.

T1  - Production of Starch-Based Bioplastic From Durio Zibethinus Murr Seed Using Glycerol as Plasticizer
JO  - Jurnal Riset Kimia
AB  - Bioplastics are bio-based plastics from natural resources, made to replace conventional plastics. The utilization of biopolymers in bioplastics provide a faster degradation compared to petroleum-based plastics. Starch-based bioplastic from mixing Durio zibethinus Murr starch and glycerol as plasticizer have been conducted. In this research, the concentration of glycerol has been varied to study the effect on starch-based bioplastics mechanical properties. The tensile strength for Durio zibethinus Murr starch-based bioplastic with 20% glycerol was 50.28 MPa with 13.3% elongation. The functional group found on the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectra indicated the presence of O-H stretch, C-H stretch, C=O stretch, and C-O stretch which stated the formation of bioplastic. The image results gained from scanning electron microscope (SEM) showed that the morphology surface of bioplastic was less homogenous and rough. The soil burial test for biodegradability showed Durio zibethinus Murr starch-based bioplastic achieved 38.9% weight loss in a 5-day observation.

T1  - Innovative Forest Products in the Circular Bioeconomy
JO  - Open Research Europe
AB  - Background: The forest-based industry has been moving towards the manufacture of bio-based products in response to the increasing concern by consumers and governments regarding the use of non-renewable materials and the generation of residues. Various innovative technologies geared towards reducing the environmental footprint of products and processes are currently being developed and applied in the forest-based industry. This study presents some innovative wood-based products that are about to enter the market or that are already being commercialized but have the potential to expand in market size. Methods: We collected data from interviews and a survey with organisations working with product development and manufacturing, and from the literature. Results: Many innovative products that are already produced at an industrial scale, such as cross-laminated timber, wood-based composites, and lyocell, can still increase their market share in the coming years. Some of the up-and-coming products with high potential to substitute fossil-based materials and will likely enter the market in the near future are wood foam, lignin-based adhesives, glycols, bioplastics, and textile fibres. Our study indicates that, although biomass demand is expected to increase, stakeholders do not consider future supply a limiting factor. Conclusions: The ease of market introduction of innovative products relies heavily on the products’ ability to take advantage of existing value chains. Overall, many of the reviewed products have the advantage of being ‘drop-in’. This is because products that require adjustments to production lines are less likely to get into the market without strong external drivers that push for bio-based alternatives. According to stakeholders, the economic viability and the market expansion of these products could be encouraged to a certain extent by EU policies, and certain barriers could be alleviated by reducing bureaucracy, increasing the support for pilot-scale to full-scale production, and increasing subsidies for bio-based alternatives.

T1  - Synthesis and Detailed Characterization of Sustainable Starch‐based Bioplastic
JO  - Journal of Applied Polymer Science
AB  - There is an urgent requirement of replacing the environmentally hazardous petroleum‐based plastics with sustainable and efficient starch‐based bioplastics. Development and detailed characterization of the biodegradable bioplastics from plant‐based polysaccharides such as starch is essential to reduce plastic pollution in the environment. In this research, bioplastics were developed from an equivalent blend of starch from two different sources namely rice and potato (1:1, w/w), crosslinked with different concentrations of citric acid (CA). The effect of CA cross‐linking of starch‐based bioplastics was investigated on its physicochemical and functional properties. The X‐ray diffraction (XRD) spectra revealed that the synthesized bioplastics were amorphous in nature with broad diffraction peaks. Further, the peak at 1716 cm−1 in Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra indicated the formation of ester bonds in CA cross‐linked bioplastics. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) revealed the surface roughness of the bioplastics decreased with increasing concentration of CA. Mechanical and thermal properties of bioplastics were characterized using universal testing machine, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), respectively.

T1  - Jackfruit Starch Based Blends With Polyvinylpyrrolidone: Preparation, Structural Characterization, and Biodegradable Properties
JO  - Macromolecular Symposia
AB  - Starch is extracted from the seeds of ripen jackfruit (Artocarpus heterophyllus) cultivated in Nepal by treating with distilled water and alkali solution. The properties of extracted starch are evaluated by measuring ash content, moisture content, and amylose content. A series of starch‐based biodegradable blends with polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) are prepared through solution casting method and their biodegradable properties are studied. The blend is characterized by thickness measurement, water solubility test, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), optical microscopy, and biodegradability test. The thickness measurement shows the linear increase in thickness of the blend with the addition of starch. The water solubility test reveals the higher solubility of PVP in water than that of the starch. FTIR spectra of PVP/thermoplastic starch (PVP/TPS) blends exhibit the existence of relevant functional groups of both starch and PVP, the peaks shifting, and the change in nature of the peaks after degradation. Optical microscopy reveals the nonuniform dispersion of starch particles in the PVP matrix and the appearance of holes and fractures in composite subjected to compost soil for degradation. The biodegradability study proves that the loading of starch to PVP accelerates the degradation process.

T1  - Removal and Recovery of Nutrients and Value-Added Products From Wastewater: Technological Options and Practical Perspective
JO  - Systems Microbiology and Biomanufacturing
AB  - Wastewaters from various process industries, namely food and agricultural, sugar mill, brewery, milk, vegetable and fruit, and meat and fisheries processing industries and their wastewater effluents contain nutrients, organic matter, inorganic, heavy metals, suspended solids, and pathogens. The discharges of non-treated wastewater enter the nearby aquatic ecosystem (e.g., lakes, rivers) and are a significant concern due to the presence of different nutrients, competing ions and C containing pollutants. It causes excessive growth of algae, loss of habitat/species, and other negative impacts on human health/environment. In the present review, different treatment approaches have been discussed in utilizing these nutrients to synthesize value-added products such as biopolymer, biofuel, pigment, organic acid, or enzymes. These biopolymers can be used to prepare various food products/packaging materials. Dextran, chitosan, carrageenan, alginate, and pectin are good examples of non-food biopolymers. Besides these products, poly-β-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) synthesis from wastewater nutrients is reported as a new source of bio-nanocomposite materials/biopolymer-based coatings. In this review, the different treatment approaches are discussed, which are being used worldwide for the removal/recovery of nutrients, toxic pollutants, and the potential resource recovery of value-added products from wastewater.

T1  - Use Phase and End-of-Life Modeling of Biobased Biodegradable Plastics in Life Cycle Assessment: A Review
JO  - Clean Technologies and Environmental Policy
AB  - AbstractDue to the negative environmental impacts along the life cycle of fossil-based plastics, there is an increased interest in the development of biobased and biodegradable plastics. Especially, biodegradable bioplastics possess different material characteristics than fossil-based plastics and can therefore be expected to perform differently during the product use and in end-of-life (EOL) phases. Thus, it is important to consider the material performance and behavior of biobased plastics in life cycle assessment studies. In practice, this is often a difficult task due to lack of data. The purpose of this review study is to analyze how contemporary LCA method models the use and EOL phases of biobased biodegradable plastics, with a specific focus on how the properties of these chemical novel materials are considered in LCA modeling. The first part of the review summarizes recommendations for the use phase and EOL modeling of biobased plastics. The second part analyzes 42 bioplastic LCAs in relation to these recommendations. The results of the review reveal that the use phase is commonly neglected in LCAs of bioplastics. Moreover, it is shown that EOL modeling in LCAs of biobased biodegradable plastics is often based on data that is non-specific for the analyzed material(s). The results of the review call for more research on the specific material properties of newly developed biobased biodegradable plastics, as these data are needed to decrease uncertainties in bioplastic LCAs.

T1  - Effects of Starch-Glycerol Concentration Ratio on Mechanical and Thermal Properties of Cassava Starch-Based Bioplastics
JO  - Jurnal Sains Materi Indonesia
AB  - This study aimed to investigate the effects of different starch-glycerol concentration ratio on mechanical and thermal properties of cassava starch bioplastics. Bioplastics were prepared by mixing starch with glycerol at different starch-glycerol w/w ratio (2.5:1, 2.75:1, 3:1 and 3.5:1). Mechanical properties was evaluated by measuring tensile strength and elongation at break where thermal properties was assessed by thermogravimetric analysis to determine the glass transition temperature (Tg), melting temperature (Tm) and melting enthalpy (ΔHm) of bioplastics. Microstructure and chemical interactions in bioplastics were evaluated by SEM and FTIR. The surface hydrophobicity was determined by measuring the water contact angle. The increase of starch-glycerol concentration in bioplastics formed rough surface where the interaction of glycerol and starch molecules mainly occurred through hydrogen bonds. It also formed stronger and more rigid structure with the increase in tensile strength from 1.90 MPa to 2.47 MPa and the decrease in elongation at break from 8.55% to 5.92%. Furthermore, the increase of starch-glycerol concentration increased Tg from 37.5 ºC to 38.6 ºC, Tm from 96.3 ºC to 120.7 ºC and ΔHm from 100.4 J/g to 155 J/g. Moreover, surface contact angle of bioplastics was increased from 40.6º to 60.2º with the increase of starch-glycerol concentration ratio.

T1  - Eco-Efficiency Assessment of Bioplastics Production Systems and End-of-Life Options
JO  - Sustainability
AB  - Abstract: Bioplastics demand has been increased globally due to concerns regarding environmentally friendly consumption and production. Polylactic acid (PLA), polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs), and polybutylene succinate (PBS) are promising bioplastics with bio-based feedstocks and property of biodegradability. They are produced by bacterial fermentation of sugars from carbohydrate sources. With flexibility in their properties, PLA, PHAs, and PBS can potentially substitute conventional plastics such as polypropylene (PP), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), and polystyrene (PS). This study aims at evaluating the environmental and economic sustainability of bioplastics production together with end-of-life (EOL) options. The combination of environmental and economic indicators, eco-efficiency (E/E), was selected to investigate the performance of PLA, PHAs, and PBS from sugarcane and cassava in comparison with PP. The environmental impacts were determined using life cycle assessment. The product cost was used to represent the economic value. The E/E results showed that the environmental and economic sustainability could be enhanced with 100% mechanical recycling of all kinds of studied plastics. It is also important to highlight that mechanical recycling showed a better performance in terms of E/E than composting of bioplastics.

T1  - Natural Polymeric Materials: A Solution to Plastic Pollution From the Agro-Food Sector
JO  - Polymers
AB  - Conventional petroleum-derived plastics represent a serious problem for global pollution because, when discarded in the environment, are believed to remain for hundreds of years. In order to reduce dependence on fossil resources, bioplastic materials are being proposed as safer alternatives. Bioplastics are bio-based and/or biodegradable materials, typically derived from renewable sources. Food waste as feedstock represents one of the recent applications in the research field of bioplastics production. To date, several food wastes have been used as raw materials for the production of bioplastics, including mostly fruit and vegetable wastes. The conversion of fruit and vegetable wastes into biomaterials could occur through simple or more complex processes. In some cases, biopolymers extracted from raw biomass are directly manufactured; on the other hand, the extracted biopolymers could be reinforced or used as reinforcing agents and/or natural fillers in order to obtain biocomposites. The present review covers available results on the application of methods used in the last 10 years for the design of biomaterials obtained from formulations made up with both fruits and vegetables by-products. Particular attention will be addressed to the waste pre-treatment, to the bioplastic formulation and to its processing, as well as to the mechanical and physical properties of the obtained materials.

T1  - Stability of Antimicrobial, Antioxidant, and Functional Properties of Pectin‐based Film Incorporated With Thymus Capitatus and Cinnamomum Verum Essential Oils
JO  - Journal of Food Safety
AB  - AbstractBiopolymer‐based films present numerous environmental advantages. The current study aims to investigate the impact of storage time on the antimicrobial, antioxidant, and functional properties of pectin‐based films containing Thymus capitatus (TEO) and Cinnamomum verum (CEO) essential oils (EOs). Films were prepared using the solution casting method; their different properties were evaluated over 1 month at room temperature. Both types of films displayed strong antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), Listeria monocytogenes (L. monocytogenes), Escherichia coli (E. coli), and Salmonella typhimurium (S. typhimurium). Pectin‐based film incorporated with CEO displayed greater antioxidant activity than film incorporated with TEO. The two EOS increased the films' elongation at break and tensile strength. However, their moisture content and thickness decreased. The antibacterial and antioxidant activities of the CEO‐ and TEO‐based films decreased after 4 weeks of storage, while moisture content increased. However, the films' mechanical parameters remained stable during the entire storage period.

T1  - Synthesis of Water Hyacinth/Cassava Starch Composite as an Environmentally Friendly Plastic Solution
JO  - Equilibrium Journal of Chemical Engineering
AB  - &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract.&lt;/strong&gt; Conventional plastics made from petroleum polymers were the largest contributor to solid waste on earth. Environmentally friendly bioplastic fabricated by compositing starch and natural fibers were proposed to be a solution to this problem. The purpose of this research was to synthesize bioplastic from water hyacinth fiber composite with cassava starch and test its mechanical properties. Bioplastic fabrication was using melt intercalation method using water hyacinth fibers (WHF) with and without alkali treatment mixed with cassava starch (CS) and glycerol as plasticizer. The resulting bioplastic were characterized with FT-IR and tested for mechanical properties. The mechanical test results showed that water hyacinth fiber alkaline treated/cassava starch (WHF-AT/CS) bioplastic has tensile strength, % elongation, and water absorption values of 1.226 MPa, 3.33%, and 10.26%, respectively. While the bioplastic water hyacinth fiber untreated/cassava starch (WHF-UT/CS) has a tensile strength test value, % elongation, and water absorption of 0.306 MPa, 1.67%, and 11.39, respectively.  Therefore it can be said that WHF-AT/CS bioplastic has better mechanical properties when compared to WHF-UT/CS bioplastic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keywords:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="left"&gt;Biocomposite, Bioplastic, Cassava Starch, Water Hyacinth Fiber&lt;/p&gt;

T1  - Mechanical and Biodegradation Properties of Fresh and Rotten Jicama Starches Based Bioplastics
JO  - Environmental Quality Management
AB  - Recently, starch-based bioplastics have been proposed to curb the problem caused by conventional plastics. Yet, current bioplastics are made from food sources which cause competition with food industries. Hence, we have produced bioplastics using rotten starch-based material to tackle this problem. In this study, a comprehensive investigation has been carried out on the preparation of bioplastics extracted from fresh jicama (FJ) and rotten jicama (RJ). Specifically, glycerol as the plasticizer and starch contents were varied to obtain bioplastic with the optimum properties via tensile, chemical and thermal characterizations. The results have confirmed that both FJ and RJ starch bioplastics possessed similar characteristics in terms of physical appearance, transparency and chemical functionalities. Moreover, the tensile and thermal properties of RJ and FJ bioplastics fall within the range specification for packaging applications. FJ bioplastic has maximum stress of 0.43 MPa and maximum strain of 50 MPa at an optimized concentration (St31%_gly6.75) which tells that they formed stronger and higher flexibility than RJ bioplastics. Importantly, the RJ bioplastics have a faster biodegradation rate compared to FJ bioplastics. In conclusion, bioplastics from rotten starch have properties as good as FJ and served as a feasible platform for the development of bioplastics from rotten sources.

T1  - Sustainable Bioderived Polymeric Materials and Thermoplastic Blends Made From Floating Aquatic Macrophytes Such as “Duckweed”
JO  - Journal of Applied Polymer Science
AB  - Abstract
While plastics offer many conveniences to modern consumers, they represent unsustainable practices that hinder economic growth and environmental stability. Therefore, the production of biodegradable plastic from alternative feedstocks is investigated to replace conventional plastics in packaging and short‐term use markets. Duckweed represents a feedstock that elicits high biomass productivity, plus a wastewater remediation potential. To establish duckweed's potential for plastic production this study investigates the stability and thermal characteristics of plasticized and blended duckweed polymers. Duckweed biomass milled to 250 μm was plasticized using glycerol and compression molded into plastic samples. Results indicated a 3 : 1 ratio of duckweed to glycerol produced the best polymer stability. This ratio was then used to develop blends which demonstrated dispersion in biobased or polyethylene (PE) phase, except for 50% Biobased/50% PE where phase continuity was observed. Furthermore, surface morphology indicated limited homogeneity in blends and increased PE was correlated to temperature stability of biobased phase. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

T1  - Effects of Mould Temperature on Rice Bran-Based Bioplastics Obtained by Injection Moulding
JO  - Polymers
AB  - The high production rate of conventional plastics and their low degradability result in severe environmental problems, such as plastic accumulation and some other related consequences. One alternative to these materials is the production of oil-free bioplastics, based on wastes from the agro-food industry, which are biodegradable. Not only is rice bran an abundant and non-expensive waste, but it is also attractive due to its high protein and starch content, which can be used as macromolecules for bioplastic production. The objective of this work was to develop rice-bran-based bioplastics by injection moulding. For this purpose, this raw material was mixed with a plasticizer (glycerol), analysing the effect of three mould temperatures (100, 130 and 150 °C) on the mechanical and microstructural properties and water absorption capacity of the final matrices. The obtained results show that rice bran is a suitable raw material for the development of bioplastics whose properties are strongly influenced by the processing conditions. Thus, higher temperatures produce stiffer and more resistant materials (Young’s modulus improves from 12 ± 7 MPa to 23 ± 6 and 33 ± 6 MPa when the temperature increases from 100 to 130 and 150 °C, respectively); however, these materials are highly compact and, consequently, their water absorption capacity diminishes. On the other hand, although lower mould temperatures lead to materials with lower mechanical properties, they exhibit a less compact structure, resulting in enhanced water absorption capacity.

T1  - Exploring the Efficacy of Various Essential Oils in Chitosan‐based Composite Biopolymer Films for Food Packaging
JO  - Polymers for Advanced Technologies
AB  - AbstractTo ensure food and environmental safety, biodegradable packaging materials from various natural polymers are being used to preserve the high quality of foods and to increase their shelf life in addition to environmental safety in terms of biodegradability. However, these natural polymers have some disadvantages in functionality. There are many ways to improve functionality, one such way is the addition of essential oils. Therefore, this research work was done to investigate the effectiveness of four diverse essential oils (EOs), namely, lemon‐grass oil (LGO), tea‐tree oil (TTO), thyme oil (THO), and basil oil (BO) in chitosan‐based composite films. The chitosan as a biopolymer, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) as a compatibilizer, and four different essential oils@0.3% were blended to form composite food packaging films. These nanofilms had better mechanical strength, elasticity, and film thickness. Thermal stability and change in the weight of chitosan alone and composite films were determined by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to analyze the change in film surface morphology. The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrum of the base polymer exhibits characteristic peaks at 3400 cm−1 indicating the occurrence of hydrogen‐bonded OH groups, and peaks at 1500–1600 cm−1 corresponding to the amide II band and CO stretch of the acetyl group. Whereas TGA results confirmed the thermal stability of PVA and EO blended films compared to chitosan alone films. The biodegradability of antimicrobial chitosan‐based films exhibited around 15%–19% percentage of degradation in PVA blended films whereas chitosan alone degraded up to 32% after 30 days. Water vapor transmission was high in chitosan alone film (1.9%) and 0.25% in PVA/EO blended films displaying enhancement in hydrophobic qualities of the developed films due to change in hydrophobicity by EO addition. The chitosan and PVA alone films were transparent whereas EO blended films exhibited yellow coloration and became less transparent due to the oil droplets dispersion in films. The shelf life of tomato, bread, and paneer was better in lemongrass and tea tree oil‐incorporated films during storage.

T1  - Oil Palm Empty Bunches as an Alternative Raw Material for Making Bioplastics
AB  - The purpose of this research is to obtain bioplastics that are biodegradable and safe if disposed of in the environment. This bioplastic is made using Empty Bunches and white rice and plasticizer. White rice flour as a source of starch with variations in the addition of chitosan additives and glycerol plastilizer. The analysis of the biodegradable plastic products produced was tested for physical and mechanical characteristics such as thickness, water resistance test (%), biodegradation rate (%), and tensile strength (MPa). The method used is by mixing the starch from the mixture of empty bunches and white rice and adding glycerol and chitosan plasticizers. The mixture is heated at a temperature of 70 -80 0 C for 60 minutes. Data from the analysis of Biodegradable plastics products showed that the more glycerol and starch added, the greater the tensile strength and the percentage of elongation. Bioplastics produced From the data, it can be seen that 1.2 grams of chitosan has the best water resistance compared to the others, which is valued at 78.02%. This is due to the hydrophobic nature of chitosan and insoluble in water. So, the greater the chitosan concentration, the greater the % water resistance and the better the plastic resistance to water.

T1  - Overview of Bioplastic Introduction and Its Applications in Product Packaging
JO  - Coatings
AB  - Each year, more than 330 million tons of plastic are produced worldwide. The main consumers of plastics are the packaging (40%), building (20%) and automotive (8%) industries, as well as for the manufacture of household appliances. The vast majority of industrial plastics are not biodegradable and, therefore, create environmental problems due to the increase in the amount of solid waste. Studies have been conducted to produce biodegradable materials such as bioplastics to overcome this environmental problem. Bioplastics are defined as materials that are bio-based, biodegradable, or both; they can provide excellent biodegradability and can be used to help alleviate environmental problems. Therefore, this article presents an overview of the introduction of bioplastic materials and classifications, and a comprehensive review of their drawbacks and areas of importance, including basic and applied research, as well as biopolymer mixtures and biocomposites developed in the last decade. At the same time, this article provides insights into the development of bioplastics research to meet the needs of many industries, especially in the packaging industry in Malaysia. This review paper also focuses generally on bioplastic packaging applications such as food and beverage, healthcare, cosmetics, etc.

T1  - Fate of Petroleum-Based and Plant-Based Teabags Exposed to Environmental Soil Conditions for One Year
JO  - Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology
AB  - Petroleum-based plastics are materials which have provided important industrial benefits from being lightweight and having low production costs. However, plastic pollution is pervasive and ubiquitous on all environments. This has led some industries to rapidly introduce the so called ‘bioplastics’ into the market by switching the conventional ones for new plant-based alternatives with similar properties. However, little is known about the fate of such alternatives especially in the open environment. In this novel study, the degradation of teabags from eight different brands was investigated, five petroleum based (cellulose-PP blend) and three plant-based (cellulose, cellulose-PLA blend and PLA). The degradation was tested under real-environmental soil conditions over a 12-month period. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR-ATR) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) techniques were used to examine the change in polymer makeup and surface degradation of teabags at 3 weeks, 3.5, 6 and 12 months. Teabag dry weight and any retrieved fragments were measured over time. Teabags that contained a plastic blended to cellulose were brittle or degraded into smaller fragments after 3 weeks in soil. Parallel to this, the cellulose layer also degraded in this short timeline. Petroleum-based teabags produced the highest numbers of PP fragments overtime and fragmented teabags were still found after 12 months. Plant-based teabags made of cellulose only or a blend of cellulose-PLA were absent from soil samples after 3.5 months, including no fragments. Contrary to this, teabags made of PLA which were marketed as completely biodegradable, persisted completely intact in soil throughout all time points. The novel results from this study provide a perspective on plastic degradation in terrestrial sources. Based on these findings, it can be recommended that teabags mostly made of cellulose or cellulose blended with a bioplastic present in a smaller ratio, are a better alternative to petroleum-based or pure PLA plastics, in terms of rapid environmental degradation. Further studies should focus on their ecotoxicity, additive presence, microbial degradation and life cycle in order to draw a full environmental assessment.

T1  - PHB (Poly‐β‐hydroxybutyrate) and Its Enzymatic Degradation
JO  - Polymers for Advanced Technologies
AB  - Our daily life needs depend on plastics, as they are cheap and durable, so they become the most commonly used synthetic chemical products. But from an environmentalist's point of view, a major concern related to these plastics is their non-biodegradable nature. Driven by growing demand to search for sustainable solutions to dispose off generating huge volume of synthetic plastic wastes, shifted the mind of researcher towards the use of biodegradable plastics which can be completely disposed-off by microbial enzymatic degradation. These biodegradable plastics or "bioplastics" are also synthesized by microbes under certain stressed environmental conditions out of which poly(R-3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) is the most ubiquitous and best known representatives of polyhydroxyalkanoate family. The PHB is most intensively used for the innovative biomedical applications owing to suitable combination of biocompatibility, transport characteristics, and mechanical properties. These challenging aspects of PHB can be used for designing of novel medical devices, in tissue engineering, and for systematic sustained drug delivery. Lots of research reports on PHB degrading enzymes and their producing microorganisms including biochemical aspects are available but in scattered form. So this review highlighted all the relevant information of PHB and PHB-degrading enzymes starting with basic classification, synthesis, mechanism, and applications that are environment friendly and are of public interest.

T1  - Extruded Versus Solvent Cast Blends of Poly(vinyl Alcohol‐co‐ethylene) and Biopolymers Isolated From Municipal Biowaste
JO  - Journal of Applied Polymer Science
AB  - Water-soluble biopolymers (SBO) were isolated from the alkaline hydrolysate of two materials sampled from an urban waste treatment plant; that is, an anaerobic fermentation digestate and a compost. The digestate biopolymers contained more lipophilic and aliphatic C, and less acidic functional groups than the compost biopolymers. The SBO were blended with poly (vinyl alcohol-co-ethylene), hereinafter EVOH. The blends were extruded and characterized by FTIR spectroscopy, size exclusion chromatography (SEC)-multi angle static light scattering (MALS) analysis, and for their thermal, rheological, and mechanical properties. The blends behavior depended on the type of SBO and its relative content. Evidence was obtained for a condensation reaction occurring between the EVOH and SBO. The best results were obtained with the blends containing up to 10% SBO isolated from the biowaste anaerobic digestate. Compared with the neat EVOH, these blends exhibited lower melt viscosity and no significant or great difference in mechanical properties. The results on the extrudates, compared with those previously obtained on the same blends obtained by solvent casting, indicate that the blends properties depend strongly also on the processing technology.

T1  - Production of Bioplastic From Potato Peel Waste and Investigation of Its Biodegradability
JO  - International Advanced Researches and Engineering Journal
AB  - Recently, environmental problems caused by petroleum-based plastics have been increasing. Therefore, researchers have begun to investigate new materials that may be alternatives to plastics. Bioplastics are considered as green materials alternatives to plastics and they are produced from renewable resources such as corn and potatoes, or microorganisms under certain conditions. In addition, most researchers are concerned with renewable resources for non-food using, such as bioplastic production. For this reason, researchers have been focusing on the utilization of the wastes as bioplastic products. In this study, the bioplastic was produced from potato peel as the food industry waste. Also, some properties of the produced bioplastic such as water absorption capacity and biodegradability were analyzed. Furthermore, water absorption capacity and biodegradability of a commercial bioplastic were also determined in order for the comparison with the one produced from potato peel waste in different conditions. It was found that the produced potato peel bioplastic (PPB) had higher water absorption capacity than commercial bioplastic (CB). Therefore, PPB may not be used in the food service industry but can be used as packing material. Biodegradability tests showed that PPB biodegraded at about 71% in moist soil and 100% in vermicompost within four weeks. On the other hand, it was determined that CB was not degraded in the soil or in the compost in four weeks. Therefore, as a food industry waste, potato peel can be used in biodegradable bioplastic production. In this way, petroleum-based plastic pollution may be decreased both in Turkey and the world.

T1  - The Simultaneous Extraction of Cellulose Fiber and Crystal Biogenic Silica From the Same Rice Husk and Evaluation in Cellulose‐based Composite Bioplastic Films
JO  - Polymer Composites
AB  - Bioplastics are environmental‐friendly materials that have been essentially required to reduce global pollution resulting from the accumulation of conventional plastics. The current study was focused on simultaneous extraction of cellulose fiber and crystal biogenic silica from the same rice husks and preparation of silica‐reinforced cellulose‐based composite bioplastic films via casting method to evaluate in packaging applications. Herein, ZnCl2 was utilized as a solvent for the extracted cellulose fiber for the first time. As the silica content increased, barrier properties of bioplastic films increased. The highest tensile strength value in bioplastic films was obtained at 1347 kN/m2 with 2% weight silica content. The biodegradability of bioplastic films in the soil after 21 days varied between 25.5% and 55.7%, which values were significantly higher than conventional plastics. After evaluating these properties, we strongly believe that composite bioplastic films have a high potential to be utilized as green packaging material.

T1  - Facile Synthesis of Cassava Starch‐based Bioplastics Modified by Citric Acid‐epoxidized Soybean Oil Oligomers
JO  - Journal of Applied Polymer Science
AB  - The present work aimed to explore the effect of citric acid (CA) on the structures and properties of cassava starch/epoxidized soybean oils‐based bioplastics. First, citric acid‐epoxidized soybean oil oligomers (CESO) were fabricated by the reaction of epoxidized soybean oils (ESO) and CA with different molar ratios (nCA:nepoxy = 3 ~ 12). CESO were successfully synthesized as evidenced by the FTIR and GPC data. Second, the synthesized CESO were applied to fabricate the bioplastics with starch by solution casting. The prepared bioplastics were evaluated by structural, thermal, mechanical, optical, and water resistance properties. The FTIR spectra reflected that CESO showed an esterification reaction with starch. The FESEM images revealed that CESO exhibited better dispersity in the samples than ESO. The samples containing CESO got plasticized with a remarkable increase of elongation at break (3.41–6.14 times) and a decrease of the tensile strength (1.35–2.07 times) compared to that with ESO. CESO promoted significantly higher light transmittance of the bioplastics than ESO due to their better dispersibility in the bioplastics. The hydrophobicity of the bioplastics increased upon the addition of CESO. These results made the fabricated bioplastics potential substitutes for petroleum‐based plastics for industrial applications.

T1  - Recent Advancements Towards Sustainability in Rotomoulding
JO  - Materials
AB  - Rotational moulding is a unique low-shear process used to manufacture hollow parts. The process is an excellent process method for batch processing, minimal waste and stress-free parts. However, the process has drawbacks such as long cycle times, gas dependency and a limited palette of materials relative to other process methods. This review aimed to shed light on the current state-of-the-art research contributing towards sustainability in rotational moulding. The scope of this review broadly assessed all areas of the process such as material development, process adaptations and development, modelling, simulation and contributions towards applications carving a more sustainable society. The PRISMA literature review method was adopted, finding that the majority of publications focus on material development, specifically on the use of waste, fillers, fibres and composites as a way to improve sustainability. Significant focus on biocomposites and natural fibres highlighted the strong research interest, while recyclate studies appeared to be less explored to date. Other research paths are process modification, modelling and simulation, motivated to increase energy efficiency, reduction in scrap and attempts to reduce cycle time with models. An emerging research interest in rotational moulding is the contribution towards the hydrogen economy, particularly type IV hydrogen vessels.

T1  - Characteristics of Bioplastics Prepared From Cassava Starch Reinforced With Banana Bunch Cellulose at Various Concentrations
JO  - Iop Conference Series Earth and Environmental Science
AB  - Abstract
               Human activities have led to the pollution of the environment through the accumulation of plastic waste. Since plastics are resistant to decomposition resulting negative impact on the environment, there is a pressing need for the development of bioplastics. Starch is a such of natural material that can be used made of bioplastics. However, bioplastics from starch were needed to improve starch-based bioplastics due to their brittle properties. To address this issue, researchers focused on enhancing starch-based bioplastics by incorporating cellulose, particularly derived from kepok banana bunch fibers and cassava starch variety UJ3. The production process involved adding varying concentrations of 2.5, 5, 7.5, and 10 % (wt) of kepok banana bunch cellulose. The findings indicated that increasing cellulose concentration improved the characteristics of the bioplastic materials significantly. The results showed that the addition of cellulose concentration improved the mechanical properties, water vapor absorption, and biodegradability of bioplastics. With an optimal cellulose concentration level at 7.5%, remarkable enhancements in tensile strength (from 2.92 to 6.72 MPa), reduced elongation percentage (from 20.89 to 4.06%), increased Young’s Modulus values (from 13.98 to 172.52 MPa), decreased water vapor absorption rate (from 15,93 to 11,48%), and enhanced bio-degradability rating (from 29,81 to 50,69%) were observed.

T1  - Removal of As(V) From Aqueous Solutions Using Calcium-Alginate Microspheres With Encapsulated Iron Nanoparticles
JO  - Water Science &Amp; Technology Water Supply
AB  - Abstract
               This work investigated As(V) removal from aqueous solutions using calcium alginate microspheres with encapsulated iron nanoparticles (FeNPs) in batch systems. The kinetic, equilibrium, and thermodynamic parameters of the adsorption process were evaluated. Adsorbents were characterized using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy, Scanning Electron Microscopy, and Zeta Potential techniques. The FeNPs were obtained by a simple and low-cost method and they were successfully encapsulated and uniformly dispersed over the microspheres' surface. Significantly fast adsorption kinetic rates were observed due to microspheres' particle size and FeNPs encapsulation. The chemisorption mechanism was recognized in both adsorbate-adsorbent systems. The As(V) isotherms data suggested that the process is associated with heterogeneous adsorption. Available sorption sites with different adsorption energies were related to the functional groups involved in removing As(V), such as hydroxyl and carboxyl groups. Significantly high adsorption capacities were obtained for both materials, suggesting they can be competitive compared to conventional adsorbents, even at low FeNPs concentrations. Besides FeNPs encapsulation enhancing arsenate removal, higher adsorption was obtained at slightly acidic pH values and, together with their small particle size, suggests that the microspheres have a great potential to be used as arsenate adsorbents in the water treatment for human consumption.

T1  - Biodegradable Packaging Materials From Animal Processing Co-Products and Wastes: An Overview
JO  - Polymers
AB  - Biodegradable polymers are non-toxic, environmentally friendly biopolymers with considerable mechanical and barrier properties that can be degraded in industrial or home composting conditions. These biopolymers can be generated from sustainable natural sources or from the agricultural and animal processing co-products and wastes. Animals processing co-products are low value, underutilized, non-meat components that are generally generated from meat processing or slaughterhouse such as hide, blood, some offal etc. These are often converted into low-value products such as animal feed or in some cases disposed of as waste. Collagen, gelatin, keratin, myofibrillar proteins, and chitosan are the major value-added biopolymers obtained from the processing of animal’s products. While these have many applications in food and pharmaceutical industries, a significant amount is underutilized and therefore hold potential for use in the generation of bioplastics. This review summarizes the research progress on the utilization of meat processing co-products to fabricate biodegradable polymers with the main focus on food industry applications. In addition, the factors affecting the application of biodegradable polymers in the packaging sector, their current industrial status, and regulations are also discussed.

T1  - “Isolation, Screening and Quantifying of Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) Using FTIR Analysis”
AB  - Abstract
        Microorganisms produce copious macromolecules, many of which harbor tremendous biotechnological potential. One such macromolecule is polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA). It is a key substance formed as inclusion bodies by bacteria to accumulate, and reserve growth materials while confronting various stress conditions. PHA is chosen as an alternative for the production of biodegradable polymers due to their quick degradability under natural environmental conditions. The objectives of this study were to identify prospective PHA-producing bacteria and quantify the PHA production. Among 12 isolates that were isolated along the Tithal region, Gujarat; 4 PHA accumulating isolates were selected and evaluated their potential to accumulate PHB granules within the cells. TS-1, TW-4, TW-9, and TS-16 were able to accumulate 38.94%, 40.0%, 34.61%, and 59.19% PHAs respectively. The bacteria were screened using the Sudan Black B method while for confirmatory screening Nile Red method was carried out. PHA was extracted using the sodium hypochlorite method. Fourier transform-infrared (FTIR) confirmation results of the extracted and crude PHA identified its functional units as CH2, CH3, C-O, C = O, and alkyl halide groups. Research into the development of environmentally friendly biopolymer materials has been sparked by the global reliance on petroleum byproducts for the manufacture of plastics, the lack of disposal space, and growing environmental concerns over non-biodegradable synthetic plastics. In light of this, research has focused on the synthesis of polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB), one of the PHAs that has received the most attention.

T1  - Utilization of Avocado Seeds as Bioplastic Films Filler Chitosan and Ethylene Glycol Plasticizer
JO  - Asian Journal of Chemistry
AB  - The use of packaging plastics each year has increased [1], potentially producing waste that is difficult to biodegradable [2], so needed environmentally friendly plastic material (bioplastic). The research of bioplastic film usually using cellulose, protein and starch materials [3,4]. The study on starch-based bioplastic film is growing rapidly because starch is easy to obtaining and processing [5]. Research on starchbased bioplastic film has been done, including using sweet potato, rice, potato and sago [6-9]. Starch-based bioplastic films such as starch from cassava, rice and potatoes should be avoided because they interfere with food security [10], for it needs to be studied starch from unuseful grains. Study on starch-based bioplastic film from seed waste has been done such as using durian seed, jackfruit seed and others, Generally durian seed starch and jackfruit seeds have high amylose content that can be used as bioplastic materials [5,11]. Lubis et al. [11] reported that bioplastic from jackfruit seed has high tensile strength with 70.22 % starch and 16.39 % amylose. This work using avocado starch because it is content starch 73.62 % and amylopectin 73.55 % so that avocado seed has potential to be plastic film material. Manufacturing this plastic film using casting method, heating the mixture of starch-filler solution at temperature approaching gelatinization [12], starchbased bioplastics have been weaknesses among others are hydrophilic, less hydrophobic and low mechanical properties, so it is necessary to additing microcrystalline cellulose fillers,

T1  - Biodegradable Films Derived From Corn and Potato Starch and Study of the Effect of Silicate Extracted From Sugarcane Waste Ash
JO  - Acs Applied Polymer Materials
AB  - The growing concern
with the amount of plastic materials found
in the oceans makes it necessary to develop biodegradable materials
that have low toxicity to marine animals and humans, but at the same
time are resistant to the actions of microorganisms such as fungi
or bacteria. On the other hand, agricultural waste rich in inorganic
materials (such as silica) is often discarded, while it could be reused
as a source of raw material. Considering these points, sodium silicate
solution extracted from sugarcane waste ash was utilized to prepare
biodegradable bioplastics based on corn starch and potato starch.
The starch-based bioplastics were produced by casting and characterized
by several physical-chemical techniques evaluating tensile strength,
elongation at break, color analyses, transparency, opacity, moisture,
and biodegradation assay. Bioplastics prepared with corn starch presented
better physical, mechanical, and thermal properties and optical quality
than bioplastics based on potato starch. The samples called CS3 and
PS3, with 5.0% glycerol, were the most resistant to tensile strengths
of 0.73 and 0.36 MPa, respectively. On the other hand, the highest
elongation at break values were found for the samples with 7.5% glycerol
(CS9, 52.90% and PS9, 49.33%). Corn starch-based bioplastics were
more thermally resistant (CS3, 152.86 °C and CS9, 135.20 °C)
when compared to potato starch-based bioplastics (PS3, 140.39 °C
and PS9, 127.57 °C). In general, the addition of sodium silicate
solution improved the mechanical and thermal properties of both types
of bioplastics. The potato starch-based bioplastics were biodegraded
in 5 days, while those made from corn starch took almost 40 days.
The inclusion of sodium silicate inhibited fungal growth for both
corn starch and potato starch bioplastics. The results suggest that
sodium silicate solution obtained from renewable sources can be incorporated
into starch-based bioplastics for production of biodegradable packaging
with antifungal activity.

T1  - Biodegradation of Wasted Bioplastics in Natural and Industrial Environments: A Review
JO  - Sustainability
AB  - The problems linked to plastic wastes have led to the development of biodegradable plastics. More specifically, biodegradable bioplastics are the polymers that are mineralized into carbon dioxide, methane, water, inorganic compounds, or biomass through the enzymatic action of specific microorganisms. They could, therefore, be a suitable and environmentally friendly substitute to conventional petrochemical plastics. The physico-chemical structure of the biopolymers, the environmental conditions, as well as the microbial populations to which the bioplastics are exposed to are the most influential factors to biodegradation. This process can occur in both natural and industrial environments, in aerobic and anaerobic conditions, with the latter being the least researched. The examined aerobic environments include compost, soil, and some aquatic environments, whereas the anaerobic environments include anaerobic digestion plants and a few aquatic habitats. This review investigates both the extent and the biodegradation rates under different environments and explores the state-of-the-art knowledge of the environmental and biological factors involved in biodegradation. Moreover, the review demonstrates the need for more research on the long-term fate of bioplastics under natural and industrial (engineered) environments. However, bioplastics cannot be considered a panacea when dealing with the elimination of plastic pollution.

T1  - The Effect of Aqueous Urea on the Processing, Structure and Properties of CGM
JO  - Journal of Polymers and the Environment
AB  - Corn gluten meal (CGM) is potentially a costeffective raw material for producing a bioderivable thermoplastic. However, CGM disintegrates to a powder subsequent to processing with polar plasticisers, such as water. The hypothesis of this study was that aqueous urea could be used to denature protein within CGM and therefore encourage protein-protein interactions leading to consolidated bioplastics when using water as a plasticiser. To assess this, the effects of aqueous urea on structure and properties of CGM with particular focus on storage were assessed. Processing of CGM with aqueous urea produced consolidated materials. FTIR analysis showed secondary structure was modified during processing, leading to increased amounts of a-helices and random coils and reduction of the amount of intermolecular b-sheets and turns. Above 6 wt% free water, the plasticising efficiency of water in processed CGM increased as the amount of denatured proteins increased. Below 6 wt% free water, protein secondary structure did not have a significant influence on thermal and flexural properties. It was found that storage environment and urea concentration influenced the rate of drying, however, the final water content was constant relative to CGM, and not urea. The materials were resistant to cracking at urea concentrations above 8 M, provided the mass loss during storage did not exceed 15 wt%.

T1  - A Performance Study on 3d-Printed Bioplastic Pots From Soybean by-Products
JO  - Sustainability
AB  - Sustainability is a key factor in the development of new materials for plant pots, given the significant environmental impact of traditional plastic-based pots. Researchers have paid attention to developing biodegradable and sustainable alternatives to petroleum-based pots. In this study, two novel bioplastic formulations are developed, which incorporated soy-based by-product fractions to produce plant pots with self-fertilizing capability while also being cost-competitive. A 3D-printing process, fused filament fabrication, is used to produce plant containers from the filaments of soy-based new materials. Further, a small-scale greenhouse experiment is conducted to compare the performance of the soy-based 3D-printed bioplastic pots with pure polylactic acid (PLA) 3D-printed pots and traditional plastic pots, by growing a fruit-bearing plant (tomato) and a flowering plant (zinnia). Plant growth properties and root circling are analyzed, and the results show that the soy-based pots performed comparably to traditional plastic pots, especially in dry conditions, and also reduced root circling. While a more in-depth analysis is necessary, these initial findings suggest that using soy-based fractions and 3D-printing technology could provide a sustainable approach to developing plant pots, which could reduce the environmental impact of plastic-based containers and improve plant health.

T1  - Synthesis of Extracellular and Intracellular Polymers in Isolates of Azotobacter Sp
JO  - International Journal of Research in Engineering and Technology
AB  - Soil is principal source of diverse group of microorganisms. The bacterial genera-Azotobacter is known asymbiotic diazotroph for long time and used as biofertilizer with multipurpose activities that improve plant productivity by maintaining sustainable soil health. Azotobacter species (A. beijerinckii, A. chroococcum, A. vinelandii)  synthesize extracellular (alginate) and intracellular polymer (Poly-β-hydroxybutyrate). Alginates are linear copolymers of β-D-mannuronic acid and α-L-guluronic acid. Poly-βhydroxybutyrate is lipid inclusion body, common in wide range of bacteria. Both the polymers are commercial components with high applied value in different fields. Azotobacter species are used as bio-inoculants in various cultivable crops to improve yield as they fix atmospheric nitrogen asymbiotically. In the present study we have screened the rhizospheric samples of cultivable crop plants like tomato, chili, rice, sugarcane and maize for Azotobacter species. The bacterial isolates were identified based on morphological and biochemical methods. Whey, wheat bran and molasses were used as cheap substrates for production of polymers. The substrates used in our study are inexpensive and could reduce the production cost of these polymers.

T1  - Optimal Iron Concentrations for Growth-Associated Polyhydroxyalkanoate Biosynthesis in the Marine Photosynthetic Purple Bacterium Rhodovulum Sulfidophilum Under Photoheterotrophic Condition
JO  - Plos One
AB  - Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) are a group of natural biopolyesters that resemble petroleum-derived plastics in terms of physical properties but are less harmful biologically to the environment and humans. Most of the current PHA producers are heterotrophs, which require expensive feeding materials and thus contribute to the high price of PHAs. Marine photosynthetic bacteria are promising alternative microbial cell factories for cost-effective, carbon neutral and sustainable production of PHAs. In this study,
     
      Rhodovulum sulfidophilum
     
     , a marine photosynthetic purple nonsulfur bacterium with a high metabolic versatility, was evaluated for cell growth and PHA production under the influence of various media components found in previous studies. We evaluated iron, using ferric citrate, as another essential factor for cell growth and efficient PHA production and confirmed that PHA production in

      sulfidophilum
     
     was growth-associated under microaerobic and photoheterotrophic conditions. In fact, a subtle amount of iron (1 to 2 μM) was sufficient to promote rapid cell growth and biomass accumulation, as well as a high PHA volumetric productivity during the logarithmic phase. However, an excess amount of iron did not enhance the growth rate or PHA productivity. Thus, we successfully confirmed that an optimum concentration of iron, an essential nutrient, promotes cell growth in

T1  - Polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB)-Based Biodegradable Polymer From Agromyces Indicus: Enhanced Production, Characterization, and Optimization
JO  - Polymers
AB  - Recently, there has been significant interest in bio-based degradable plastics owing to their potential as a green and sustainable alternative to synthetic plastics due to their biodegradable properties. Polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) is a biodegradable polymer that is produced by bacteria and archaea as carbon and energy reserves. Due to its rapid degradation in natural environments, it can be considered a biodegradable plastic alternative. In the present study, a dye-based procedure was used to screen PHB-producing bacteria isolated from mangrove soil samples. Among the seven isolates, Agromyces indicus (A. indicus), identified by means of 16S rRNA analysis, accumulated the highest amount of PHB. The extracted polymer was characterized by a UV–Vis spectrophotometer, Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and for the presence of the phbB gene, which confirmed the structure of the polymer as PHB. The maximum PHB production by A. indicus was achieved after 96 h of incubation at a pH of 8.0 and 35 °C in the presence of 2% NaCl, with glucose and peptone as the carbon and nitrogen sources, respectively. The strain was found to be capable of accumulating PHB when various cheap agricultural wastes, such as rice, barley, corn, and wheat bran, were used as the carbon sources. The response surface methodology (RSM) through the central composite design (CCD) for optimizing the PHB synthesis was found to be highly efficient at augmenting the polymer yields. As a result of the optimum conditions obtained from the RSM, this strain can increase the PHB content by approximately 1.4-fold when compared with an unoptimized medium, which would substantially lower the production cost. Therefore, the isolate A. indicus strain B2 may be regarded as one of the best candidates for the industrial production of PHB from agricultural wastes, and it can remove the environmental concerns associated with synthetic plastic.

T1  - Fabricating Starch-Based Bioplastic Reinforced With Bagasse for Food Packaging
JO  - Circular Economy and Sustainability
AB  - Nowadays, food packaging plastics is one of the largest markets that consume thermoplastics. Regardless, the packaging industry accounts for the majority of plastic waste that is polluting the environment. Furthermore, because petroleum sources are limited and on the verge of depletion, there is a need to develop alternative materials that can perform the same functions as conventional plastics. Hence, many solutions have emerged in the now time being. Biopolymers have demonstrated great potential as green materials, despite their poor market penetration. They can be a very remarkable alternative and moreover possess an outstanding friendliness characteristic. Bioplastics are a critical key player in turning the plastics sector from a wasteful linear economy to a circular economy. Their expanding use will have better impacts, not just in terms of the environment and economy, but also in terms of functionality. This paper has been attempted to accomplish a biopolymer-made out of starch and sugarcane bagasse pulp in the regard of replacing the current standard plastic as packaging material. The results state the fabricated biopolymer of starch and bagasse composite is very prominent to take the lead as packing material of future possibilities for green material adoption. Moreover, the addition of the bagasse enhanced the mechanical property, and the castor oil boosted the flexibility and hence elongation. Through such work of the article, the conclusion of the bio-based film to compete at a superior level with the current plastic film properties in the market is basically proved.

T1  - Corn Starch/Pva Bioplastics—The Properties and Biodegradability Study Using Chlorella Vulgaris Cultivation
JO  - Asia-Pacific Journal of Chemical Engineering
AB  - In this study, a biodegradable alternative to synthetic plastics was explored, where gelatinized corn starch was blended with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) using the solution casting method at different ratios. Tensile tests showed that films made of only starch exhibited the lowest tensile strength at 3.66 MPa, which increased as the ratio of PVA in the blend was raised. The water vapor transmission rate was similar even when the starch content was changed. PVA was shown to increase the solubility of the film in water, and starch demonstrated a better ability to absorb water than that of PVA, with the pure starch film swelled up to 167% of its original weight. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) analysis revealed that there was no significant chemical interaction between the starch and PVA which could alter their respective functional groups. Bioplastic films made of only starch showed the least amount of degradation after 3 days when buried in soil, while water uptake in films made of PVA caused it to turn into a sticky gel‐like substance. Chlorella vulgaris exhibited a higher preference for PVA as the substrate when compared to starch. This revealed that C. vulgaris showed promise as a candidate for breaking down the bioplastic films when grown as a heterotroph.

T1  - The Effect of Choline Chloride: Acetamide Deep Eutectic Solvent to Physicochemical and Mechanical Properties of Pectin-Based Bioplastic
JO  - Iop Conference Series Materials Science and Engineering
AB  - Abstract
               The rapid increment of synthetic plastic wastes in our environment has triggered in production and development of new biomaterial for resolving problems such as pollution as well as weak mechanical properties. Pectin polysaccharides are recognized as a new potential biomaterial in developing bioplastic. The main purpose of this study is to develop and characterize citrus pectin bioplastic using deep eutectic solvents (DES) of choline chloride: acetamide (1:2), CC:Ac as a plasticizer. The potential of produced bioplastic (BP-CC:Ac) was studied through investigation of their physicochemical and mechanical properties which include pH, thickness, opacity, solubility, tensile strain, tensile stress and Young Modulus. A citrus pectin-based bioplastic without the plasticizer (CI) and with the conventional plasticizer of pure acetamide (C2) were prepared as controls. The produced BP-CCAc showed a higher value of thickness (0.2658 ± 0.0015mm), opacity (0.492 ± 0.02A), and solubility (23.26 ± 0.03%) than the control, CI (0.1963 ± 0.0032mm, 0.407 ± 0.01A, and 16.42 ± 0.01% respectively) and C2 (0.1833 ± 0.001mm, 0.447 ± 0.01A, and 17.88 ± 0.05% respectively). The high acidity of BP-CC:Ac (pH 3.21) provide a strong inhibition toward bacteria which is highly demanding for medical purposes. The tensile strain, tensile stress and Young Modulus of BP-CC:Ac were measured at 5.080 ± 0.04 %, 2.221 ± 0.08 MPa and 113.946 ± 0.08 MPa, respectively. It was found the BP-CCAc was more flexible and have smooth surface texture than both controls, CI and C2 which suitable for plastic wrapping. Other than being natural and biodegradable, the addition of CCAc DES had improved the physicochemical and mechanical properties of pectin based-bioplastic. In conclusion, the addition of CCAc DES has enhanced the properties of BP-CCAc and increased the potential of plastic as an ecofriendly and sustainable future material.

T1  - Introduction of Triboelectric Positive Bioplastic for Powering Portable Electronics and Self-Powered Gait Sensor
JO  - Acs Applied Energy Materials
AB  - Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) are in the center of alternative energy scavenger technologies because of numerous possible applications in remote energy harvesting and self-powered sensing. Although there exists a large number of triboelectric negative polymers, the choice of triboelectric positive polymers is indeed limited. Here we report for the first time the use of thermoplastic starch (TPS) as a triboelectric positive material for designing TENGs. Our bioplastic-based highly durable TENG (b-TENG) can generate open-circuit peak-topeak output voltage of ∼560 V with output current density of ∼120 mA m −2 and instantaneous output power density of 17 W m −2 . We demonstrate b-TENG as a portable power source by powering more than 100 commercial blue LEDs, LED strips, and seven segment LCD screens. Additionally, the b-TENG can be used as a self-powered pedometer for step counter, a speedometer for human walking and running, and a human gait analysis sensor to assess physical activity breeding its futuristic biomedical applications for healthcare purposes. The introduction of ecofriendly bioplastic TPS as a triboelectric positive component has great potential for biomedical applications because of the abundance, biodegradability, low cost, and ease in fabrication process.

T1  - Robust and High-Performance Textile-Based Triboelectric Nanogenerators Integrated With 2D Materials for Sustainable Self-Powered Wearable Electronics
AB  - The human body continuously generates ambient mechanical energy through diverse movements, such as walking and cycling, which can be harvested via various renewable energy harvesting mechanisms. Triboelectric Nanogenerator (TENG) stands out as one of the most promising emerging renewable energy harvesting technologies for wearable applications due to its ability to harness various forms of mechanical energies, including vibrations, pressure, and rotations, and convert them into direct current (DC) electricity. However, their application is limited due to challenges in achieving performance, flexibility, low power consumption, and durability. Here, we present a robust and high-performance self-powered system integrated into cotton fabric by incorporating a textile-based triboelectric nanogenerator (T-TENG) based on 2D materials, addressing both energy harvesting and storage. The proposed system extracts significant ambient mechanical energy from human body movements and stores it in a textile supercapacitor (T-Supercap). The integration of 2D materials (graphene and MoS2) in fabrication enhances the performance of T-TENG significantly, as demonstrated by a record-high open-circuit voltage of 1068V and a power density of 14.64 W/m2 under a force of 22N. The developed T-TENG in this study effectively powers 200+ LEDs and a miniature watch while also charging the T-Supercap with 4-5N force for efficient miniature electronics operation. Integrated as a step counter within a sock, the T-TENG serves as a self-powered step counter sensor. This work establishes a promising platform for wearable electronic textiles, contributing significantly to the advancement of sustainable and autonomous self-powered wearable technologies.

T1  - Wearable Woven Triboelectric Nanogenerator Utilizing Electrospun PVDF Nanofibers for Mechanical Energy Harvesting
JO  - Micromachines
AB  - Several wearable devices have already been commercialized and are likely to open up a new life pattern for consumers. However, the limited energy capacity and lifetime have made batteries the bottleneck in wearable technology. Thus, there have been growing efforts in the area of self-powered wearables that harvest ambient mechanical energy directly from surroundings. Herein, we demonstrate a woven triboelectric nanogenerator (WTENG) utilizing electrospun Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) nanofibers and commercial nylon cloth to effectively harvest mechanical energy from human motion. The PVDF nanofibers were fabricated using a highly scalable multi-nozzle far-field centrifugal electrospinning protocol. We have also doped the PVDF nanofibers with small amounts of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) to improve their triboelectric performance by facilitating the growth of crystalline β-phase with a high net dipole moment that results in enhanced surface charge density during contact electrification. The electrical output of the WTENG was characterized under a range of applied forces and frequencies. The WTENG can be triggered by various free-standing triboelectric layers and reaches a high output voltage and current of about 14 V and 0.7 µA, respectively, for the size dimensions 6 × 6 cm. To demonstrate the potential applications and feasibility for harvesting energy from human motion, we have integrated the WTENG into human clothing and as a floor mat (or potential energy generating shoe). The proposed triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) shows promise for a range of power generation applications and self-powered wearable devices.

JO  - Acs Applied Polymer Materials
AB  - The fibrous surface of textiles offers a larger contact area and continuous contact with the skin, which makes them a prominent candidate for biomechanical energy harvesting using the triboelectric nanogenerator principle. Herein, a lightweight, comfortable, and robust wearable triboelectric nanogenerator (W-TENG) device is fabricated for its application in self-powered technologies. The TENG output is enhanced via a three-way process: using a textured yarn and modifying the textile material and its structural variation in fabric. The triboelectric performance is correlated to the surface morphology, roughness, and dielectric properties. The current research compares woven and knitted fabric triboelectric nanogenerators using nylon, cotton, polypropylene (PP), and polyester. The surface roughness of the different textile materials and the irregular surface morphology of woven and knitted structures are studied using a threedimensional (3D) optical profilometer. It is observed that the convolutions on the PP and nylon yarn and the 3D configuration of knitted fabric impart higher roughness than their woven counterpart providing a larger contact area. The higher contact area between the nylon/PP pair of knitted fabric has shown 240.55, 64.96, and 460% increments in voltage, current, and power density, respectively, compared to the woven W-TENG. The knitted fabric-based TENG has additionally demonstrated improved breathability and suitability to generate electrical energy from various human motions.

T1  - Woven Fabric Triboelectric Nanogenerator for Biomotion Energy Harvesting and as Self-Powered Gait-Recognizing Socks
JO  - Energies
AB  - In recent years, rapid advancements have developed in multifunctional and wearable electronics, which call for more lightweight, flexible energy sources. However, traditional disposable batteries and rechargeable batteries are not very suitable because of their bulky appearance, limited capacity, low flexibility, and environmental pollution problem. Here, by applying a mature manufacturing technology that has existed in the textile field for a long time, a woven fabric triboelectric nanogenerator (WF-TENG) with a thinner structure that can be mass-fabricated with low cost, perfect stability, and high flexibility is designed and reported. Due to the good intrinsic quality of TENGs, the maximum voltage of this WF-TENG can easily reach 250 V under a pressure of 3.5 kPa and a tapping frequency of 0.33 Hz. Because of the stable plain-woven structure, the output voltage can remain relatively stable even after the WF-TENG has been working for about 5 h continuously, clearly demonstrating its robustness and practical value. Moreover, good sensitivity endows this WF-TENG with the capability of being applied as self-powered sensors, such as a self-powered smart real-time gait-recognizing sock. This WF-TENG shows us a simple and effective method to fabricate a wearable textile product with functional ability, which is very meaningful for future research.

JO  - Advanced Materials
AB  - of textile materials from ancient times to the present, and then to the future is shown in Figure 1, indicating that typical textile materials that can highlight the characteristics of the times have experienced the transformation from natural fiber, artificial/synthetic fiber, reinforced fiber, functional fiber, conductive fiber, and then to smart fiber. Accordingly, the primary purposes or service demands of textile materials have also changed imperceptibly from the aspects of covering, warmth preservation, protection, beauty, security, comfort, health, interaction, and intelligence. On these grounds, it can be found that with the advances of Internetof-Things and artificial intelligences, textile materials are no longer limited to the traditional functions of protection, warm-keeping, and aesthetic, but should be given more smart or intelligent attributes, such as energy harvesting, [1][2][3] energy storage, [4,5] autonomous response, [6,7] information interaction, [8,9] data transmission, [10,11] light emitting, [12,13] color changing, [14] shape memory, [15] thermal regulation, [16,17] selfhealing, [18a]  self-adaption, [19] etc. In addition, considering that human oriented wearable electronics will be highly integrated and miniaturized, completely safe and comfortable, and fully portable in the future, it is also expected to design various functional electronics directly into textile structures, such as fibers, yarns or fabrics. [20,21] At present, a variety of functional attributes have been well integrated with textile materials, mainly including energy, [3,4,12,22] sensing, [8,10,23,24] comfort, [16,25a,26,27]   and protection, [19,[28][29][30] which endows this kind of traditional necessity of life with new development vitality (Figure 2). In particular, through the seamless combination of electrical functionalities and textile elements, a new type of textiles, namely smart textiles, have been developed, which can perceive, react and adapt to environmental stimuli, including machinery, magnetism, heat, electricity, light, chemistry, biology, and others. [31][32][33][34][35] It can be predicted that the realization of highperformance electrical function and comfortable to wear is the unremitting pursuit goal of the next generation of smart textiles.It is noteworthy that the effective operation of most additional functions in smart textiles depends on sustained and stable energy sources. In other words, we need reliable, compact but high-performance electricity supply systems to power emergingThe seamless integration of emerging triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) technology with traditional wearable textile materials has given birth to the next-generation smart textiles, i.e., textile TENGs, which will play a vital role in the era of Internet of Things and artificial intelligences. However, low output power and inferior sensing ability have largely limited the development of textile TENGs.

T1  - A Smart Kevlar-Based Triboelectric Nanogenerator With Enhanced Anti-Impact and Self-Powered Sensing Properties
JO  - Smart Materials and Structures
AB  - Abstract
               A novel single electrode triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) with high energy-harvesting performance and safeguarding behavior has been developed by integrating carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and shear stiffening gel (SSG) on Kevlar fabric. The output voltage and power of the three layer structure SSG/CNTs/Kevlar-based TENG (S-TENG) reaches to as high as 41.27 V and 212.90 μW, respectively. Due to the good triboelectric property, S-TENG also acts as a wearable self-powered device to harvest as well as monitor various human motions. More importantly, when impacted by a 1.26 kg impactor dropping from 30 cm, S-TENG with enhancing stiffness can not only resist the impact force, but also gather dynamic impact energy by producing an output voltage of 1.50 V. Finally, the mechanical and the electric properties of the S-TENG under the heavy hammer impact and quasi-static piercing has simultaneously investigated. In comparison to the neat Kevlar (7.66 J), the critical impact energy resisted by S-TENG is as high as 19.16 J, indicating a better anti-impacted property. Because of the excellent triboelectric and anti-impact properties, the smart S-TENG with self-power sensing, energy-gathering and safeguarding performance possesses high potential in next generation of body armor materials, robots, wearable electronics and human-machine interactions.

T1  - Industrial Fabrication of 3D Braided Stretchable Hierarchical Interlocked Fancy‐Yarn Triboelectric Nanogenerator for Self‐Powered Smart Fitness System
JO  - Advanced Energy Materials
AB  - Sustainable, clean, random energy resources from the environment, like that from ubiquitous human biomechanical movements, are highly desirable for the information era. Such biomechanical energy can be captured via textile triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs). However, realizing a textile TENG that has a self‐driven working mode, dynamic pattern designability, high electrical performance, mechanical robustness, and industrialized fabrication is challenging because of the difficulty in fancy‐yarn structure manipulation. Here, for the first time, a 3D braided stretchable hierarchical interlocking fancy‐yarn TENG (3D HIFY‐TENG) with deoxyribonucleic acid‐like double‐wing spiral structure is industrially exploited for multifunctional energy harvesting modes and self‐powered biomechanical sensing. The 3D HIFY‐TENG can generate self‐driven triboelectrical outputs without relying on other objects by body movements. It shows a mechanical robustness (6.9 cN dtex−1), excellent stretchability (&gt;350%), weavability, washability and human‐body comfort. Moreover, geometric and mechanical behavior of the 3D HIFY‐TENG are systematically investigated theoretically and experimentally. Further, multifunctional 3D HIFY‐TENG fabrics are explored, which can not only harvest biomechanical energy and monitor body movement, but exhibit a unique adjustable pore effect, providing potential for dynamic electronic textile pattern design. In addition, a smart fitness system is developed for exercise management of real‐time exercise detection, frequency analysis, and self‐powered posture correction alarms.

T1  - Fabric‐Based TENG Woven With Bio‐Fabricated Superhydrophobic Bacterial Cellulose Fiber for Energy Harvesting and Motion Detection
JO  - Advanced Functional Materials
AB  - AbstractFabric‐based triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) exhibit superior output performance, flexibility, and wearability. However, the fabric structure often creates gaps that accumulate contaminants, which weaken the performance and durability of the TENGs. To address this challenge, a novel eco‐friendly superhydrophobic fabric‐based TENG (SF‐TENG) woven with superhydrophobic electroconductive bacterial cellulose fiber (SEBC fiber) is presented. To construct durable superhydrophobicity, an ingenious bio‐fabricated method is employed for the shell–core structure. SEBC fibers with bio‐fabricated shell–core structure exhibit excellent electroconductibility, mechanical property, biodegradability, and durable superhydrophobicity. SF‐TENG displays a maximum open‐circuit voltage of 266.0 V, a short‐circuit current of 5.9 µA, and an output power of 489.7 µW, and successfully powers devices such as stopwatch and calculator. Abilities of self‐cleaning and anti‐fouling guarantee the stable output performance of SF‐TENG under harsh environmental conditions such as liquids pouring. Furthermore, the intelligent clothing is designed based on SF‐TENG to detect motion signals, and it is further utilized to construct a Sports and Health Monitoring System as a deep application. In summary, this study provides a novel strategy of bio‐fabrication for the design and preparation of superhydrophobic electroconductive fiber with shell–core structure. The SF‐TENG demonstrates practicability, stability and is promising for wearable devices in harsh environmental conditions.

T1  - Towards Truly Wearable Systems: Optimizing and Scaling Up Wearable Triboelectric Nanogenerators
JO  - Iscience
AB  - Summary
    

     Triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) is an upcoming technology to harvest energy from ambient movements. A major focus herein is harvesting energy from human movements through wearable TENGs, which are constructed by integrating nanogenerators into clothing or accessories. Textile-based TENGs, which include fiber, yarn, and fabric-based TENG structures, account for the majority of wearable TENGs, with many designs and applications demonstrated recently. This calls for a comprehensive analysis of textile-based TENG technology, and how the state-of-the-art device optimization concepts can be deployed to construct them efficiently. Concurrently, how advanced engineering concepts and industrial manufacturing techniques, which are bound with fiber, yarn, and fabric-related developments, can be applied into the TENG context for their output enhancement is still under investigation. Herein, we fill this vital gap by analyzing the state-of-the-art developments, upcoming trends, output optimization strategies, scalability, and prospects of the textile-based TENG technology, presenting a textile engineering perspective.

T1  - Augmented Tactile-Perception and Haptic-Feedback Rings as Human-Machine Interfaces Aiming for Immersive Interactions
JO  - Nature Communications
AB  - AbstractAdvancements of virtual reality technology pave the way for developing wearable devices to enable somatosensory sensation, which can bring more comprehensive perception and feedback in the metaverse-based virtual society. Here, we propose augmented tactile-perception and haptic-feedback rings with multimodal sensing and feedback capabilities. This highly integrated ring consists of triboelectric and pyroelectric sensors for tactile and temperature perception, and vibrators and nichrome heaters for vibro- and thermo-haptic feedback. All these components integrated on the ring can be directly driven by a custom wireless platform of low power consumption for wearable/portable scenarios. With voltage integration processing, high-resolution continuous finger motion tracking is achieved via the triboelectric tactile sensor, which also contributes to superior performance in gesture/object recognition with artificial intelligence analysis. By fusing the multimodal sensing and feedback functions, an interactive metaverse platform with cross-space perception capability is successfully achieved, giving people a face-to-face like immersive virtual social experience.

T1  - A Machine‐Fabricated 3D Honeycomb‐Structured Flame‐Retardant Triboelectric Fabric for Fire Escape and Rescue
JO  - Advanced Materials
AB  - Fire disaster is one of the most common hazards that threaten public safety and social development: how to improve the fire escape and rescue capacity remains a huge challenge. Here, a 3D honeycomb‐structured woven fabric triboelectric nanogenerator (F‐TENG) based on a flame‐retardant wrapping yarn is developed. The wrapping yarn is fabricated through a continuous hollow spindle fancy twister technology, which is compatible with traditional textile production processes. The resulting 3D F‐TENG can be used in smart carpets as a self‐powered escape and rescue system that can precisely locate the survivor position and point out the escape route to timely assist victim search and rescuing. As interior decoration, the unique design of the honeycomb weaving structure endows the F‐TENG fabric with an excellent noise‐reduction ability. In addition, combining with its good machine washability, air permeability, flame‐retardency, durability, and repeatability features, the 3D F‐TENG may have great potential applications in fire rescue and wearable sensors as well as smart home decoration.

T1  - Wearable Power‐Textiles by Integrating Fabric Triboelectric Nanogenerators and Fiber‐Shaped Dye‐Sensitized Solar Cells
JO  - Advanced Energy Materials
AB  - have been developed mainly based on TiO 2 nanoparticles with the effi ciency of more than 7% and have good stability under deformation. [ 11,12 ]   Considering that solar energy is dependent on the weather and people stay most of a day indoors, mechanical energy could be an appropriate complement due to its universal availability. The triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG), [ 13,14 ] coupling the effect of contact-electrifi cation and electrostatic induction, has been demonstrated to be versatile in scavenging different types of mechanical energies, ranging from vibration, [ 15 ] wind, [ 16 ] water wave, [ 17 ] to human motions. [18][19][20] The abundant choice of materials and structure designs of the TENG enable its feasibility in integration with the E-textile for harvesting energy from human motions. Silver coating, [ 21 ] carbon nanotubes, [ 22 ] and carbon fi ber [ 23 ] were applied to textile fi bers, functioning as the electrode of the textile-based or fi ber-based TENG. In our previous studies, a woven TENG textile was realized by electroless deposition (ELD) of conformal and low-cost nickel coating to convert textile yarns/fabrics into conductive electrodes. [ 24 ] Despite these preliminary fi ndings, further research is still required to improve the output power of the TENG textile. Meanwhile, integration of the whole textile-based TENG and solar cell has seldom been found in literature, though several previous works have been reported integrated devices on fl at substrates. [ 25 ]   Herein, we developed a grating-structured TENG fabric and its integration with FDSSCs so as to achieve a whole textile-based energy harvesting system. A route of laser-scribing masking and ELD Ni plating was fi rst proposed for the synthesis of conductive circuits/patterns on the textile. Interdigitated grating-structured TENG fabrics were then fabricated in aim to convert low-frequency human motion energy into high-frequency current outputs. By reducing the grating size, large improvements were achieved in the current amplitude and output power. Furthermore, FDSSCs and TENG fabrics were integrated together into a cloth as complementary power devices for harvesting both the energy of sunshine and human motions.The energy-generating device for wearable electronics or E-textiles should be versatile for fashionable and comfortable designs. Whereas, most of the previous reported TENGs for biomechanical energy-harvesting lack this versatility. The ideal TENG for E-textiles is in the form of fabrics. As schemed in Figure 1 a, a power-textile can be designed with the fabrics of the sleeve and underneath the arm (herein after noted as slider fabric and stator fabric, respectively) functioning as two pairs Electronic-textile (E-textile) or smart textile, which integrates multifunctional electronic/optoelectronic devices into fashionable/stylish clothing, holds great promise for the next growth of the market of wearable electronics.

T1  - Textile Triboelectric Nanogenerators Simultaneously Harvesting Multiple “High-Entropy” Kinetic Energies
JO  - Acs Applied Materials &Amp; Interfaces
AB  - Distributed
renewable kinetic energies are ubiquitous but with
irregular amplitudes and frequencies, which, as one category of “high-entropy”
energies, are crucial for next-generation self-powered electronics.
Herein, we present a flexible waterproof dual-mode textile triboelectric
nanogenerator (TENG), which can simultaneously scavenge multiple “high-entropy”
kinetic energies, including human motions, raindrops, and winds. A
freestanding-mode textile TENG (F-TENG) and a contact-separation-mode
textile TENG (CS-TENG) are integrated together. The structure parameters
of the textile TENG are optimized to improve the output performances.
The raindrop can generate a voltage of up to ∼4.3 V and a current
of about ∼6 μA, while human motion can generate a voltage
of over 120 V and a peak power density of ∼500 mW m–2. The scavenged electrical energies can be stored in capacitors for
powering small electronics. Therefore, we demonstrated a facile preparation
of a TENG-based energy textile that is highly promising for kinetic
energy harvesting and self-powered electronics.

T1  - Core–Shell-Yarn-Based Triboelectric Nanogenerator Textiles as Power Cloths
JO  - Acs Nano
AB  - Although textile-based triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) are highly promising because they scavenge energy from their working environment to sustainably power wearable/mobile electronics, the challenge of simultaneously possessing the qualities of cloth remains. In this work, we propose a strategy for TENG textiles as power cloths in which core-shell yarns with core conductive fibers as the electrode and artificial polymer fibers or natural fibrous materials tightly twined around core conductive fibers are applied as the building blocks. The resulting TENG textiles are comfortable, flexible, and fashionable, and their production processes are compatible with industrial, large-scale textile manufacturing. More importantly, the comfortable TENG textiles demonstrate excellent washability and tailorability and can be fully applied in further garment processing. TENG textiles worn under the arm or foot have also been demonstrated to scavenge various types of energy from human motion, such as patting, walking, and running. All of these merits of proposed TENG textiles for clothing uses suggest their great potentials for viable applications in wearable electronics or smart textiles in the near future.

T1  - Continuous and Scalable Manufacture of Amphibious Energy Yarns and Textiles
JO  - Nature Communications
AB  - Biomechanical energy harvesting textiles based on nanogenerators that convert mechanical energy into electricity have broad application prospects in next-generation wearable electronic devices. However, the difficult-to-weave structure, limited flexibility and stretchability, small device size and poor weatherability of conventional nanogenerator-based devices have largely hindered their real-world application. Here, we report a highly stretchable triboelectric yarn that involves unique structure design based on intrinsically elastic silicone rubber tubes and extrinsically elastic built-in stainless steel yarns. By using a modified melt-spinning method, we realize scalable-manufacture of the self-powered yarn. A hundred-meter-length triboelectric yarn is demonstrated, but not limited to this size. The triboelectric yarn shows a large working strain (200%) and promising output. Moreover, it has superior performance in liquid, therefore showing all-weather durability. We also show that the development of this energy yarn facilitates the manufacturing of large-area self-powered textiles and provide an attractive direction for the study of amphibious wearable technologies.

T1  - Enhancing the Performance of Fabric-Based Triboelectric Nanogenerators by Structural and Chemical Modification
JO  - Acs Applied Materials &Amp; Interfaces
AB  - Fabric-based
triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) are promising
candidates as wearable energy-harvesting devices and self-powered
sensors. Booting the power generation performance is an eternal pursuit
for TENGs. Herein, an efficient approach was proposed to enhance the
triboelectric performance of commercial velvet fabric by enriching
the fiber surface with hierarchical structures and amide bonds through
chemical grafting of carbon nanotube (CNT) and poly­(ethylenimine)
(PEI) via a polyamidation reaction. With an optimized modifier concentration,
the fabric-based TENG easily achieved over 10 times improvement in
output voltage and current at a low modifier content of less than
1 wt %. The modified-fabric-based TENG was fully washable and exhibited
excellent robustness and long-term stability. With a maximum power
density of 3.2 W/m2 achieved on a 5 × 106 Ω external resistor, the TENG was able to serve as a power
source for various small electronics such as pedometer, digital watch,
calculator, and digital timer. In addition, the TENG demonstrated
capability in self-powered tactile and pressure sensing and promising
potential in human–computer interface applications. The approach
proposed provides a feasible path for boosting the triboelectric performance
of fabric-based TENGs and gives insights into the design of fabric-based
nanogenerators and smart textiles.

T1  - Ultra-Flexible and Large-Area Textile-Based Triboelectric Nanogenerators With a Sandpaper-Induced Surface Microstructure
JO  - Materials
AB  - Wearable triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) have attracted interest in recent years, which demand highly flexible, scalable, and low-cost features. Here, we report an ultra-flexible, large-scale and textile-based TENG (T-TENG) for scavenging human motion energy. The triboelectric layer was derived from the polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) film with a cost-effective paper-induced rough surface via a facile doctor-blending technology. Ag-coated chinlon fabric (ACF) with ultra-flexible, large-scale and conductive characteristics was used as the electrode. The as-fabricated PDMS-based ACF (PACF) composites possess a 240 × 300 mm2 superficial area and remain highly flexible under mechanical squeezing, folding and even tearing deformation. The maximum output charge of ~21 μC and voltage of 80.40 V were therefore achieved to directly power 100 LEDs based on the high surface area of 762.73 mm2 which was rationally replicated from the sandpaper of the T-TENG. Moreover, the output voltage signal can be also used as a trigger signal of a movement sensor. Importantly, the explicit theoretical model corresponding to T-TENG was quantitatively investigated under different applied force, frequency and effective surface factor.

T1  - An Ultralight Self-Powered Fire Alarm E-Textile Based on Conductive Aerogel Fiber With Repeatable Temperature Monitoring Performance Used in Firefighting Clothing
JO  - Acs Nano
AB  - Firefighting protective clothing
is an essential equipment that
can protect firefighters from burn injuries during the firefighting
process. However, it is still a challenge to detect the damage of
firefighting protective clothing at an early stage when firefighters
are exposed to excessively high temperature in fire cases. Herein,
an ultralight self-powered fire alarm electronic textile (SFA e-textile)
based on conductive aerogel fiber that comprises calcium alginate
(CA), Fe3O4 nanoparticles (Fe3O4 NPs), and silver nanowires (Ag NWs) was developed, which
achieved ultrasensitive temperature monitoring and energy harvesting
in firefighting clothing. The resulting SFA e-textile was integrated
into firefighting protective clothing to realize wide-range temperature
sensing at 100–400 °C and repeatable fire warning capability,
which could timely transmit an alarm signal to the wearer before the
firefighting protective clothing malfunctioned in extreme fire environments.
In addition, a self-powered fire self-rescue location system was further
established based on the SFA e-textile that can help rescuers search
and rescue trapped firefighters in fire cases. The power in the self-powered
fire location system was offered by an SFA e-textile-based triboelectric
nanogenerator (TENG). This work provided a useful design strategy
for the preparation of ultralight wearable temperature-monitoring
SFA e-textile used in firefighting protective clothing.

T1  - Charge Dispersion Strategy for High‐Performance and Rain‐Proof Triboelectric Nanogenerator
JO  - Advanced Materials
AB  - AbstractTriboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) is becoming a sustainable and renewable way of energy harvesting and self‐powered sensing, because of its low cost, simple structure, and high efficiency. However, the output current of existing TENGs is still low. We propose that the output current of TENGs could be dramatically improved if the triboelectric charges could distribute inside the triboelectric layers. Herein, we developed a novel single‐electrode conductive network‐based TENG (CN‐TENG) by introducing a conductive network of multiwalled carbon nanotubes in dielectric triboelectric layer of thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU). In this CN‐TENG, the contact electrification‐induced charges distribute not only on the surface but also interior of the dielectric TPU layer. Thus, the short‐circuit current of CN‐TENG improved for 100 folds, compared with that of traditional dielectric TENG. Additionally, our CN‐TENG, even without packing, can work stably in high‐humidity environments and even in the rain, which is another main challenge for conventional TENGs due to charge leakage. Furthermore, our CN‐TENG was applied, for the first time, to successfully distinguish conductive and dielectric materials. This work provides a new and effective strategy to fabricate TENGs with high output current and humidity‐resistivity, greatly expanding their practical applications in energy harvesting, movement sensing, human‐machine interaction, etc.This article is protected by copyright.

JO  - Advanced Materials Technologies
AB  - Textile‐based triboelectric nanogenerators (t‐TENGs) possess the unique wearability characteristics of fabrics. The advent of t‐TENGs not only broadens the development direction of new materials in the textile industry but also endows TENGs with greater application potential. However, the electrical output and desired comfort properties of t‐TENGs remain limited and impractical. Important progress has been made in the exploitation of t‐TENGs in recent years. In this review, the basic classifications of comfort, including sensorial and tactile comfort, fit comfort, heat–moisture comfort, and appearance aesthetics, are introduced. Combining the wearability of textiles, the recent progress in the development of comfortable t‐TENGs is systematically summarized and discussed from the following aspects: tactile comfort of t‐TENGs, stretchability of t‐TENGs, breathability of t‐TENGs, washability of t‐TENGs, aesthetics of t‐TENGs, and multifunctionality of t‐TENGs. Additionally, the enhanced output performance, power management, integration strategies, and mass production of t‐TENGs are discussed, and the main applications of wearable t‐TENGs are described. Finally, the existing challenges and future research direction of t‐TENGs are presented, which may contribute to promoting further research and applications of wearable t‐TENGs.

T1  - Self-Powered Smart Insole for Monitoring Human Gait Signals
JO  - Sensors
AB  - With the rapid development of low-power consumption wireless sensors and wearable electronics, harvesting energy from human motion to enable self-powered sensing is becoming desirable. Herein, a pair of smart insoles integrated with piezoelectric poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) nanogenerators (NGs) are fabricated to simultaneously harvest energy from human motion and monitor human gait signals. Multi-target magnetron sputtering technology is applied to form the aluminum electrode layers on the surface of the PVDF film and the self-powered insoles are fabricated through advanced 3D seamless flat-bed knitting technology. Output responses of the NGs are measured at different motion speeds and a maximum value of 41 V is obtained, corresponding to an output power of 168.1 μW. By connecting one NG with an external circuit, the influence of external resistance, capacitor, and motion speed on the charging characteristics of the system is systematically investigated. To demonstrate the potential of the smart insoles for monitoring human gait signals, two subjects were asked to walk on a treadmill at different speeds or with a limp. The results show that one can clearly distinguish walking with a limp from regular slow, normal, and fast walking states by using multiscale entropy analysis of the stride intervals.

T1  - Stabilizing the Energy Harvesting of PVDF‐Fabric‐Based TENGs Exposed to Moisture and Dust Particles by O2 and CF4 Plasma Treatments
JO  - Advanced Materials Technologies
AB  - are commonly used in wearable PENGs owing to their flexibility and their higher high piezoelectric coefficient compared with that of other bulk polymers. [2][3][4] Furthermore, when stretched under a strong applied electric field, PVDF chains arrange in a β-phase crystal structure, and electric dipoles are formed due to differences in the electronegativities of their constituent atoms. [2] The electrical output performance of PENG can be improved by optimizing structural parameters, such as surface roughness, alignment of fibers, and thickness, which influence the compression characteristics of the material. [1] Zaarour et al. reported that output voltages of electrospun PVDF web-based PENGs are higher when fibers are wrinkled and aligned in one direction compared with the case when the fibers are smooth and disordered. [5] Meanwhile, because of the poor breathability of PVDF films and the poor durability of electrospun PVDF webs, interest in developing breathable, durable yarns and woven fabrics from PVDF for use in wearable smart textiles has steadily increased. [6] Furthermore, PVDF fabrics have great potential for use in triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs), because PVDF chains can readily accept negative charges when rubbed against other materials owing to their high electron affinity. [7,8] In a TENG, electricity is generated by electrostatic induction from the accumulation of electric charges when two materials with different triboelectric charges are rubbed together. [9] Thus, textile-based TENGs can harvest energy when friction with other fabrics occurs through various human motions such as swinging arms and running. [10,11] However, practical application to smart textiles is limited by the susceptibility of TENGs to moisture and other contaminants. The output voltage decreases in moist environments because water molecules can increase surface conductivity, which prevents the generated triboelectricity from accumulating on the material surface and leads to discharge. [12] To overcome this problem, Kim et al. coated the surface of polyester fabric with a fluorine compound, which enabled energy harvesting over a wider range of relative humidities and improved the stability of the electrical output performance of the fabric-based TENG. [13] Moreover, when the surface was covered with dust particles, the electrical output performance Superhydrophobic polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) fabrics comprising electrospun PVDF yarns are developed via O 2 and CF 4 plasma treatments to achieve stable triboelectric energy harvesting performance. The dynamic water droplet behavior, self-cleaning ability, and electrical output performance of the fabrics before and after sequential treatments with O 2 plasma for 12 min and CF 4 plasma for 4 min are measured. The electrical output performance for all fabricbased piezoelectric nanogenerators (PENGs) is higher than that for PVDF filmbased PENGs. Furthermore, plasma treatment enhances the electrical output performance of all triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs), particularly the...

T1  - Stretchable and Tailorable Triboelectric Nanogenerator Constructed by Nanofibrous Membrane for Energy Harvesting and Self‐Powered Biomechanical Monitoring
JO  - Advanced Materials Technologies
AB  - Wearable triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) with both functionality and comfort have become an appealing field of research for portable electronic devices recently. Here, a breathable, stretchable, and tailorable TENG that enables both energy harvesting and biomechanical monitoring is designed. Two layers of nanofiber membranes, which consist of polyvinylidene fluoride supported by conducting fabric and thermoplastic polyurethanes (TPU) supported by Ag elastic fabric, are welded into arch structures through ultrasonic welding technique. As the bottom layer of the arch, the TPU/Ag layer with consistent stretchability guarantees the stretchable of the TENG. Therefore, the TENG can collect various types of irregular movements, such as stretching, pressing, and twisting motions, even the combination of the above all motions. Under twisting stretch, the open‐circuit voltage and short‐circuit current of one basic unit can reach up to 170 V and 4.5 µA, respectively. Besides, the welded TENG is tailorable and it still maintains certain output even if it is partially cut or damaged. The continuous arch‐structured TENGs can also be used as self‐powered motion sensors to constantly monitor the intensity and frequency of human body movements. Thus, this work opens up a new idea for preparation of wearable TENG with both multifunction and better comfort.

T1  - Waterproof, Breathable, and Antibacterial Self‐Powered E‐Textiles Based on Omniphobic Triboelectric Nanogenerators
JO  - Advanced Functional Materials
AB  - Multifunctional electronic textiles (e-textiles) incorporating miniaturized electronic devices will pave the way toward a new generation of wearable devices and human-machine interfaces. Unfortunately, the development of e-textiles is subject to critical challenges, such as battery dependence, breathability, satisfactory washability, and compatibility with mass production techniques. This work describes a simple and cost-effective method to transform conventional garments and textiles into waterproof, breathable, and antibacterial e-textiles for self-powered human-machine interfacing. Combining embroidery with the spray-based deposition of fluoroalkylated organosilanes and highly networked nanoflakes, omniphobic triboelectric nanogenerators (R F -TENGs) can be incorporated into any fiber-based textile to power wearable devices using energy harvested from human motion. R F -TENGs are thin, flexible, breathable (air permeability 90.5 mm s −1 ), inexpensive to fabricate (&lt;0.04$ cm −2 ), and capable of producing a high power density (600 µW cm −2 ). E-textiles based on R F -TENGs repel water, stains, and bacterial growth, and show excellent stability under mechanical deformations and remarkable washing durability under standard machine-washing tests. Moreover, e-textiles based on R F -TENGs are compatible with large-scale production processes and exhibit high sensitivity to touch, enabling the cost-effective manufacturing of wearable human-machine interfaces.

T1  - Woven Structured Triboelectric Nanogenerator for Wearable Devices
JO  - Acs Applied Materials &Amp; Interfaces
AB  - ABSTRACT: To date, quite a few wearable electronics have entered the market, which are changing the life pattern of consumers. However, the limited lifetime and energy storage capacity have made rechargeable batteries the bottleneck in wearable technology, especially with the increase of number of wearable devices and their large distribution. To solve this problem, we demonstrate a woven-structured triboelectric nanogenerator (W-TENG) using commodity nylon fabric, polyester fabric, and conductive silver fiber fabric. With the advantage of being flexible, washable, breathable, wearable, and able to be triggered by a freestanding triboelectric layer, this W-TENG can move freely without any constraint and is suitable for wearable electronics. To demonstrate the potential applications of the W-TENG, the W-TENG is integrated into shoes, coats, and trousers to harvest different kinds of mechanical energy from human motion. This work presents a new approach in applying triboelectric nanogenerator to wearable devices.

T1  - Energy Harvesting and Sensing Integrated Woven Structure Kneepad Based on Triboelectric Nanogenerators
JO  - Advanced Materials Technologies
AB  - AbstractTriboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) are extensively studied because of their great potential in energy harvesting and sensing. Traditional chemical batteries cannot meet the requirements of wearable electronic products because of their inherent limitations such as large weight, large size, limited endurance, and limited lifespan. To address the issue, the self‐powered energy harvester has attracted considerable interest among researchers. Here, the woven structure TENG consists of flexible silicone mixed with polyvinylidene fluoride as dielectric layers, silver fabric, and conductive tape as electrodes. The electrical output performance of the pattern structure processed by tip design is nearly three times higher. The whole TENG and flexible printed circuit board are encapsulated by polydimethylsiloxane film, reducing inconvenient, and discomfort sensation during wearing. The woven structure TENG can not only harvest energy to power wearable electronic devices but also be used to recognize human motion as the waveforms changing when people are in different states. Taking the knee bending angle data as an example to conduct machine learning, it is able to classify different states of human motion. This work extends the application of the woven TENG as an integrated device for sensing and energy harvesting.

T1  - An Eco-Friendly Porous Nanocomposite Fabric-Based Triboelectric Nanogenerator for Efficient Energy Harvesting and Motion Sensing
JO  - Acs Applied Materials &Amp; Interfaces
AB  - A wearable and effective tribopositive material, especially an economical and eco-friendly triboelectric fabric developed from biomaterials, is highly crucial for the development of green wearable triboelectric nanogenerators. In this work, we design a porous nanocomposite fabric (PNF) with strong charge accumulation capacity through a facile dry-casting method and use it as a tribopositive material to construct attractive wearable triboelectric nanogenerators (abbreviated as TENGs). Specifically, the porous nanocomposite is developed by the incorporation of nano-Al 2 O 3 fillers into cellulose acetate networks. By adjusting the concentration of casting solution and the content of nano-Al 2 O 3 fillers, we systematically engineer the physical properties of the PNF for obtaining a large triboelectric charge yield. When a 10 wt % solution concentration and 10 wt % nanofiller content are adopted for the PNF, the corresponding PNF-TENG can deliver an electrical performance of ∼2.5 mW/cm 2 on a 0.8 MΩ external resistor. This remarkable output can be ascribed to the synergistic effect between the appropriate porous network and improved dielectric properties of the nanocomposite. Moreover, the PNF-TENG also exhibits good reliable electrical outputs under multiple stain-washing measurements or after experiencing cyclical contact− separation 13,500 times. Also, the device is capable of charging various capacitors, lighting LED arrays, and driving commercial wrist watches and is proven to be an efficient and reliable green wearable power source. Furthermore, a PNF-TENG-based elbow supporter and a grip ball, as self-powered sensors, are proposed to realize real-time detection for human actions during sports exercise. This work proposes an eco-friendly nanocomposite fabric as an effective tribopositive material, verifies the feasibility of developing environmentally friendly wearable power sources and sensors, and provides new insights into the design of green wearable triboelectric nanogenerators.

T1  - All-Yarn Triboelectric Nanogenerator and Supercapacitor Based Self-Charging Power Cloth for Wearable Applications
JO  - Nanotechnology
AB  - Abstract
               Despite rapid developments, multifunctional wearable electronics are still not significant in practical applications as compared to portable and stretchable power devices. In this paper, we present the flexible and easy large-scale production of single-electrode mode triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) and supercapacitor yarn-based self-charging power fabric, for simultaneously converting and storing biomechanical energy. Fabricated using traditional knitting technologies, the self-charging power fabric can adapt to complex mechanical deformations owing to its high flexibility and stretchability. Additionally, the output characteristics of the TENG fabric were systematically investigated with the purpose of energy generation. The TENG fabric can generate a maximum peak power density of ∼90 mW·m−2 using nylon as the contact material, with an operating frequency of 4 Hz. The as-prepared yarn-based supercapacitor exhibited high capacitance, good cycling stability, and flexibility, making it an appropriate wearable energy-storage device. Moreover, the proposed design uses energy harvested from biomechanical motions to sustainably power portable electronic devices. The results of this study indicate that the proposed design is a promising sustainable power source for wearable electronic devices.

JO  - Advanced Functional Materials
AB  - Integrating power into fabrics offers exciting opportunities for wearable technologies, which has long remained challenging to make flexible, high temperature resistant textile‐based powers. Here, an all yarns‐based triboelectric nanogenerator (Y‐TENG) is proposed to harvest electrical energy and sense biological motion for temperatures between 25 and 400 °C, the upper limit of temperature is greatly improved. The Y‐TENG is capable of outputting a transferred charge density of 30 nC cm−2, the external load resistance is 180 MΩ, and the peak power reaches 0.17 mW, and the average response time is lower than 15 ms. Based on a simple processing strategy, when introducing silica aerogel during electrospinning of polyimide nano‐covered layer to make multi‐ply and stabilized triboelectric yarns. Unlike ordinary fibers and yarns, the core‐shell structured design also shows a high sensitivity to all kinds of mechanical triggering sources. Furthermore, a self‐powered movement characteristic monitoring system by coordinating smart protective suit is further developed to provide real‐time sensing and rescuing assistance. This aerogel nano‐covered triboelectric yarn has great application prospects for energy generation and motion detection in high‐temperature and many other high‐risk environments.

T1  - All‐Organic Smart Textile Sensor for Deep‐Learning‐Assisted Multimodal Sensing
JO  - Advanced Functional Materials
AB  - Smart textile for sensor is identified as a superior platform with greatly improved convenience and comfort for wearable bioelectronics. However, most reported textile-based sensors cannot fully demonstrate the inherent advantages of textiles, such as comfortability, breathability, biocompatibility, and environmental friendliness, mainly due to the intrinsic limitation of non-textile or inorganic components. Here, an all-textile, all-organic, washable, and breathable sensor with discriminable pressure, proximity, and temperature sensing function is first reported. Multiple sensing functions and outstanding washability are demonstrated. The all-textile sensor can also be seamlessly integrated into diverse types of fabrics to realize wide-range sensing of human activities and noncontact stimuli without sacrificing biocompatibility and comfortability. Additionally, by combining with the deep-learning technique, an all-textile sensing system is established to recognize object shape, contactless trajectory, and even environmental temperature. These results open a new avenue for designing low-cost, washable, comfortable, and biocompatible green textile electronics, providing a meaningful guideline in intelligent textiles.

T1  - AI‐Enabled Metal‐Polymer Plain Bearing Based on the Triboelectric Principle
JO  - Advanced Functional Materials
AB  - AbstractWith the rapid development of the Internet of Things and artificial intelligence (AI), the requirement for sensing technologies for smart bearings has increased dramatically. The general bearing sensors can only recognize the basic information from temperature or vibration, far from satisfying the self‐diagnosis and self‐maintenance. Recently, self‐powered sensing technologies based on triboelectric nanogenerators have paved a new route for fabricating smart bearings. In this study, the triboelectric principle is applied to a commercial metal‐polymer plain bearing (MPPB) bearing, which can achieve self‐sensing, self‐diagnosis, and self‐maintenance. The geometrical structure of the triboelectric MPPB (T‐MPPB) is designed to balance the output efficiency and external load, and the super durability and load capability are verified. Besides, the mechanism behind the output change trend under boundary and hydrostatic fluid lubrication is revealed for the first time. Furthermore, the deep learning algorithm can classify the lubrication states with highly accurate performance. The proposed T‐MPPB has the potential to achieve self‐maintenance with the lubricating pump according to the lubrication condition classified by the AI. This research not only establishes the feasibility of designing self‐powered smart MPPB but also demonstrates a way for identifying lubrication states, thus achieving self‐diagnosis and self‐maintenance ability by self‐powered sensors.

T1  - Shape Adaptable and Highly Resilient 3D Braided Triboelectric Nanogenerators as E-Textiles for Power and Sensing
JO  - Nature Communications
AB  - Combining traditional textiles with triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) gives birth to selfpowered electronic textiles (e-textiles). However, there are two bottlenecks in their widespread application, low power output and poor sensing capability. Herein, by means of the three-dimensional five-directional braided (3DB) structure, a TENG-based e-textile with the features of high flexibility, shape adaptability, structural integrity, cyclic washability, and superior mechanical stability, is designed for power and sensing. Due to the spatial framecolumn structure formed between the outer braided yarn and inner axial yarn, the 3DB-TENG is also endowed with high compression resilience, enhanced power output, improved pressure sensitivity, and vibrational energy harvesting ability, which can power miniature wearable electronics and respond to tiny weight variations. Furthermore, an intelligent shoe and an identity recognition carpet are demonstrated to verify its performance. This study hopes to provide a new design concept for high-performance textile-based TENGs and expand their application scope in human-machine interfacing.

T1  - Versatile Core–Sheath Yarn for Sustainable Biomechanical Energy Harvesting and Real‐Time Human‐Interactive Sensing
JO  - Advanced Energy Materials
AB  - The emergence of stretchable textile‐based mechanical energy harvester and self‐powered active sensor brings a new life for wearable functional electronics. However, single energy conversion mode and weak sensing capabilities have largely hindered their development. Here, in virtue of silver‐coated nylon yarn and silicone rubber elastomer, a highly stretchable yarn‐based triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) with coaxial core–sheath and built‐in spring‐like spiral winding structures is designed for biomechanical energy harvesting and real‐time human‐interactive sensing. Based on the two advanced structural designs, the yarn‐based TENG can effectively harvest or respond rapidly to omnifarious external mechanical stimuli, such as compressing, stretching, bending, and twisting. With these excellent performances, the yarn‐based TENG can be used in a self‐counting skipping rope, a self‐powered gesture‐recognizing glove, and a real‐time golf scoring system. Furthermore, the yarn‐based TENG can also be woven into a large‐area energy‐harvesting fabric, which is capable of lighting up light emitting diodes (LEDs), charging a commercial capacitor, powering a smart watch, and integrating the four operational modes of TENGs together. This work provides a new direction for textile‐based multimode mechanical energy harvesters and highly sensitive self‐powered motion sensors with potential applications in sustainable power supplies, self‐powered wearable electronics, personalized motion/health monitoring, and real‐time human‐machine interactions.

T1  - Multiscale Engineering of Sustainable and Versatile All‐Fiber Triboelectric Nanogenerator Based on Multifunctional Fibrous Materials and 3D Woven Architecture
JO  - Advanced Materials Technologies
AB  - With the development of energy‐harvesting fabrics, woven structured textile‐based triboelectric nanogenerators (T‐TENGs) are widely proposed. However, most T‐TENGs with woven structures consist of one material, which greatly limits the functionality of T‐TENGs. This work focuses on structural design and rational material configuration to realize versatility of woven‐structured T‐TENG by a green, eco‐friendly, scalable production method. A 3D triboelectric nanogenerator fabric (3D SP‐FTENG) is proposed, which performs excellent electrical output (27.33 V, 1.76 µA, and 61.6 mW m−2) and wearability (directional water transport and breathability) as well as antibacterial activity. Moreover, in contrast to the previously reported multilayer T‐TENGs which are constructed by directly stacking multilayer functional fabrics together, the fabric interface of this new structure fabricated by weaving the support area and the functional area together is not easily delaminated. The 3D SP‐FTENG demonstrates outstanding durability (machine washability and ultrahigh abrasion resistance). In addition, the SP‐FTENG is able to drive wearable electronics and be used as a self‐powered sensor, such as constantly monitoring the movement signals of human body. This study presents a novel and sustainable strategy for the development of eco‐friendly multifunctional T‐TENGs.

T1  - Comparative Study of Triboelectric Nanogenerators With Differently Woven Cotton Textiles for Wearable Electronics
JO  - Polymers
AB  - A comparative study of the electrical performance of triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) with plain- and 2/1 twill-woven cotton textiles was conducted. Furthermore, the microstructures of the cotton fiber surfaces were examined to understand the fundamental mechanical interaction among the cotton fibers in the TENGs. The TENG with 2/1 twill-woven cotton textiles exhibited higher output voltages compared to that with plain-woven cotton textiles. The difference in the output voltage between the two types of TENGs resulted from the difference in triboelectric charge generation between the constituent cotton textiles. The higher output voltage of the TENG with 2/1 twill-woven cotton textiles was attributed to the higher density in triboelectric interactions among the cotton fiber molecules.

T1  - Recent Progress on Textile-Based Triboelectric Nanogenerators
JO  - Nano Energy
AB  - Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENG) are one of the most promising candidates for powering wearable and portable devices. Example TENGs have demonstrated flexibility, light weight, biocompatibility, versatility and good performance. Textiles are a potential substrate onto, or into, which wearable technology is increasingly being incorporated but supplying power remains an enduring challenge. TENGs are a potential textile based mechanical energy harvesting power supply and there has been an increasing effort to combine TENGs with fabrics. A significant challenge exists in the integration without losing the performance of the TENG or the original properties (appearance, breathability, washability, and durability) and feel of the textile. Various approaches towards the realisation of textile-based TENGs (T-TENGs) have been demonstrated. Depending on its structure, T-TENGs can be divided into two main types, fabric-based TENG and fibre-based TENG. The fabric-based TENG is composed of conventional and/or modified fabrics, which serve as a substrate and/or a triboelectric material. The fibre-based TENG is fabricated as a single fibre or a collection of interlaced fibres. This paper provides an up to date review of the progress in the research of T-TENGs. The paper covers the basic operating principles, possible operation modes, textile manufacturing methods, material selections, T-TENG fabrication process, surface modification and structural designs. Issues, such as standardised measurement parameters, the challenges and limitations of T-TENG are discussed.

T1  - Textile-Based Triboelectric Nanogenerator With Alternating Positive and Negative Freestanding Woven Structure for Harvesting Sliding Energy in All Directions
JO  - Nano Energy
AB  - A novel textile-based triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) with woven structure operating in freestanding triboelectric-layer mode, defined as a woven-TENG, has been developed. Whereas most woven-structured TENGs operate in contact-separation mode and consist of one type of triboelectric material, this woven-TENG comprises woven electrodes and woven strips of positive and negative triboelectric material, which form a checker-like pattern over the electrodes with matching periodicity. The implementation of the positive and negative triboelectric material significantly improves the performance of the woven-TENG. Furthermore, in contrast to the conventional grating-structured and woven-structured TENG, which are designed to operate only in one moving direction, this new design also allows the woven-TENG to harvest energy from allplanar directions of movement. The woven-TENG with woven strips of nylon and polytetrafluoroethylenevinyl (PTFE) fabric can generate a root mean square (RMS) open-circuit voltage of 62.9 V, an RMS short-circuit current of 1.77 µA and a maximum RMS power of 34.8 µW at a load resistance of 50 MΩ, a mechanical oscillation of 2 Hz and a contact force of 5 N. This corresponds to a maximum RMS power density of 5.43 mW/m 2 .

T1  - High-Performance All-Textile Triboelectric Nanogenerator Toward Intelligent Sports Sensing and Biomechanical Energy Harvesting
JO  - Acs Applied Materials &Amp; Interfaces
AB  - Merging textiles with advanced energy harvesting technology via triboelectric effects brings novel insights into self-powered wearable textile electronics. However, fabrication of a comfortable textile-based triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) with high outputs remains challenging. Herein, we propose a highly flexible, tailorable, single-electrode all-textile TENG (t-TENG) with both wear comfort and high outputs. A dielectric modulated porous composite coating containing poly(vinylidene fluoride)hexafluoropropylene copolymer and barium titanate nanoparticles is constructed on conductive fabric to counterpart with highly positive glass fiber fabric through knotted yarn bonding, maintaining the superiority of textiles and strong triboelectricity. Through the synergistic optimization of charge storage via dielectric modulation and charge dissipation offset by electrical poling, remarkable outputs (261 V, 1.5 μA, and 12.7 nC) are obtained from a miniaturized, lightweight t-TENG (2 × 2 cm 2 , 130 mg) with an instantaneous power density of 654.48 mW•m −2 , as well as excellent electrical robustness and device durability over 20,000 cycles. The t-TENG also exhibits a high sensitivity of 3.438 V•kPa −1 in the force region (1−10 N), demonstrating great potential in TENG-based intelligent sports sensing applications for monitoring and correcting the basketball shooting hand and foot arch posture. Furthermore, over 110 light-emitting diode arrays can be lightened up by gently tapping this miniaturized t-TENG. It also offers a wearable power source scheme through integrating the single-electrode device into clothing and utilizing the skin as the grounded electrode, revealing its ease of integration and biomechanical energy harvesting capability. This work provides an attractive paradigm for next-generation textile electronics with well-balanced device performance and wear comfort.

T1  - Triboelectric Nanogenerator‐Enabled 3D Microporous Polydimethylsiloxane–Graphene Oxide Nanocomposite for Flexible Self‐Powered Humidity Sensing Applications
JO  - Energy Technology
AB  - The imperative to meet the energy needs of contemporary electronic devices has spurred extensive exploration into self‐powered systems. Given the anticipated ubiquity of sensor networks in future cities, a novel battery‐free sensing paradigm, rooted in triboelectric nanogenerators (TENG), has gained prominence. Utilizing mechanical energy otherwise wasted daily for electricity generation presents a promising alternative to conventional sensors. Embedding the sensing electrode within the TENG structure enables the creation of gas sensors suitable for portable and wireless applications. This study focuses on fabricating a 3D microporous sponge of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) using sugar cubes and graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets. Leveraging the hydrophilic properties of the GO enhances moisture absorption, elevating the humidity sensor's responsivity. In addition, the porous structure not only improves sensitivity to high humidity but also mitigates surface saturation issues prevalent in nonporous sensors. The porous self‐powered sensor, composed of PDMS with 0.5 wt% of GO, exhibits a response of up to 2500%, quantified as ((ΔV/V) × 100%), to relative humidity changes from 20% to 99%. Furthermore, the response and recovery times stand at 1.2 and 2.3 s, respectively. These findings underscore the feasibility of integrating TENG electrodes, utilizing a porous PDMS–GO nanocomposite, to create various types of integrated gas sensors.

T1  - Scalable and Ultra‐Sensitive Nanofibers Coaxial Yarn‐Woven Triboelectric Nanogenerator Textile Sensors for Real‐Time Gait Analysis
JO  - Advanced Science
AB  - AbstractYarn‐woven triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) have greatly advanced wearable sensor technology, but their limited sensitivity and stability hinder broad adoption. To address these limitations, Poly(VDF‐TrFE) and P(olyadiohexylenediamine (PA66)‐based nanofibers coaxial yarns (NCYs) combining coaxial conjugated electrospinning and online conductive adhesive coating are developed. The integration of these NCYs led to enhanced TENGs (NCY‐TENGs), notable for their flexibility, stretchability, and improved sensitivity, which is ideal for capturing body motion signals. One significant application of this technology is the fabrication of smart insoles from NCY‐TENG plain‐woven fabrics. These insoles are highly sensitive and possess antibacterial, breathable, and washable properties, making them ideal for real‐time gait monitoring in patients with diabetic foot conditions. The NCY‐TENGs and their derivatives show immense potential for a variety of wearable electronic devices, representing a considerable advancement in the field of wearable sensors.

T1  - Bioinspired Integrated Triboelectric Electronic Tongue
JO  - Microsystems &Amp; Nanoengineering
AB  - AbstractAn electronic tongue (E-tongue) comprises a series of sensors that simulate human perception of taste and embedded artificial intelligence (AI) for data analysis and recognition. Traditional E-tongues based on electrochemical methods suffer from a bulky size and require larger sample volumes and extra power sources, limiting their applications in in vivo medical diagnosis and analytical chemistry. Inspired by the mechanics of the human tongue, triboelectric components have been incorporated into E-tongue platforms to overcome these limitations. In this study, an integrated multichannel triboelectric bioinspired E-tongue (TBIET) device was developed on a single glass slide chip to improve the device’s taste classification accuracy by utilizing numerous sensory signals. The detection capability of the TBIET was further validated using various test samples, including representative human body, environmental, and beverage samples. The TBIET achieved a remarkably high classification accuracy. For instance, chemical solutions showed 100% identification accuracy, environmental samples reached 98.3% accuracy, and four typical teas demonstrated 97.0% accuracy. Additionally, the classification accuracy of NaCl solutions with five different concentrations reached 96.9%. The innovative TBIET exhibits a remarkable capacity to detect and analyze droplets with ultrahigh sensitivity to their electrical properties. Moreover, it offers a high degree of reliability in accurately detecting and analyzing various liquid samples within a short timeframe. The development of a self-powered portable triboelectric E-tongue prototype is a notable advancement in the field and is one that can greatly enhance the feasibility of rapid on-site detection of liquid samples in various settings.

T1  - High Ion-Conducting PVA Nanocomposite Hydrogel-Based Wearable Piezoelectric and Triboelectric Sensors for Harsh Environments
JO  - Biomacromolecules
AB  - Traditional hydrogel-based wearable sensors with flexibility,
biocompatibility,
and mechanical compliance exhibit potential applications in flexible
wearable electronics. However, the low sensitivity and poor environmental
resistance of traditional hydrogels severely limit their practical
application. Herein, high-ion-conducting poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA)
nanocomposite hydrogels were fabricated and applied for harsh environments.
MXene ion-conducting microchannels and poly(sodium 4-styrenesulfonate)
ion sources contributed to the directional transport of abundant free
ions in the hydrogel, which significantly improved the sensitivity
and mechanical–electric conversion of the nanocomposite hydrogel-based
piezoelectric and triboelectric sensors. More importantly, the glycerol
as an antifreezing agent enabled the hydrogel-based sensors to function
in harsh environments. Therefore, the nanocomposite hydrogel exhibited
high gauge factor (GF) at −20 °C (GF = 3.37) and 60 °C
(GF = 3.62), enabling the hydrogel-based sensor to distinguish different
writing letters and sounding words. Meanwhile, the hydrogel-based
piezoelectric and triboelectric generators showed excellent mechanical–electric
conversion performance regardless of low- (−20 °C) or
high- (60 °C) temperature environments, which can be applied
as a visual feedback system for information transmission without external
power sources. This work provides self-powered nanocomposite hydrogel-based
sensors that exhibit potential applications in flexible wearable electronics
under harsh environmental conditions.

T1  - A Tough Monolithic‐Integrated Triboelectric Bioplastic Enabled by Dynamic Covalent Chemistry
JO  - Advanced Materials
AB  - AbstractElectronic waste is a growing threat to the global environment and human health, raising particular concerns. Triboelectric devices synthesized from sustainable and degradable materials are a promising electronic alternative, but the mechanical mismatch at the interface between the polymer substrate and the electrodes remains unresolved in practical applications. This study used the sulfhydryl silanization reaction and the chemical selectivity and site specificity of the thiol‐disulfide exchange reaction in dynamic covalent chemistry to prepare a tough monolithic integrated triboelectric bioplastic. The stress is dissipated by covalent bond adaptation to the interface interaction, which makes the polymer dielectric layer to the conductive layer have a good interface adhesion effect (220.55 kPa). The interfacial interlocking of the polymer substrate with the conductive layer gives the triboelectric bioplastic excellent tensile strength (87.4 MPa) and fracture toughness (33.3 MJ m−3). Even when subjected to a tension force of 10000 times its weight, it still maintains a stable triboelectric output with no visible cracks. This study provides new insights into the design of reliable and environmentally friendly self‐powered devices, which is significant for the development of flexible wearable electronics.This article is protected by copyright.

T1  - Cellulose‐Based Fully Green Triboelectric Nanogenerators With Output Power Density of 300 W M−2
JO  - Advanced Materials
AB  - Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) have attracted increasing attention because of their excellent energy conversion efficiency, the diverse choice of materials, and their broad applications in energy harvesting devices and self‐powered sensors. New materials have been explored, including green materials, but their performances have not yet reached the level of that for fluoropolymers. Here, a high‐performance, fully green TENG (FG‐TENG) using cellulose‐based tribolayers is reported. It is shown that the FG‐TENG has an output power density of above 300 W m−2, which is a new record for green‐material‐based TENGs. The high performance of the FG‐TENG is due to the high positive charge density of the regenerated cellulose. The FG‐TENG is stable after more than 30 000 cycles of operations in humidity of 30%–84%. This work demonstrates that high‐performance TENGs can be made using natural green materials for a broad range of applications.

T1  - Single‐Thread‐Based Wearable and Highly Stretchable Triboelectric Nanogenerators and Their Applications in Cloth‐Based Self‐Powered Human‐Interactive and Biomedical Sensing
JO  - Advanced Functional Materials
AB  - The development of wearable and large‐area fabric energy harvester and sensor has received great attention due to their promising applications in next‐generation autonomous and wearable healthcare technologies. Here, a new type of “single” thread‐based triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) and its uses in elastically textile‐based energy harvesting and sensing have been demonstrated. The energy‐harvesting thread composed by one silicone‐rubber‐coated stainless‐steel thread can extract energy during contact with skin. With sewing the energy‐harvesting thread into a serpentine shape on an elastic textile, a highly stretchable and scalable TENG textile is realized to scavenge various kinds of human‐motion energy. The collected energy is capable to sustainably power a commercial smart watch. Moreover, the simplified single triboelectric thread can be applied in a wide range of thread‐based self‐powered and active sensing uses, including gesture sensing, human‐interactive interfaces, and human physiological signal monitoring. After integration with microcontrollers, more complicated systems, such as wireless wearable keyboards and smart beds, are demonstrated. These results show that the newly designed single‐thread‐based TENG, with the advantage of interactive, responsive, sewable, and conformal features, can meet application needs of a vast variety of fields, ranging from wearable and stretchable energy harvesters to smart cloth‐based articles.

T1  - Wearable Energy Harvesting-Storage Hybrid Textiles as on-Body Self-Charging Power Systems
JO  - Nano Research Energy
AB  - The rapid development of wearable electronics requires its energy supply part to be flexible, wearable, integratable and sustainable. However, some of the energy supply units cannot meet these requirements at the same time, and there is also a capacity limitation of the energy storage units, and the development of sustainable wearable self-charging power supplies is crucial. Here, we report a wearable sustainable energy harvesting-storage hybrid self-charging power textile. The power textile consists of a coaxial fiber-shaped polylactic acid/reduced graphene oxide/polypyrrole (PLA-rGO-PPy) triboelectric nanogenerator (fiber-TENG) that can harvest low-frequency and irregular energy during human motion as a power generation unit, and a novel coaxial fiber-shaped supercapacitor (fiber-SC) prepared by functionalized loading of a wet-spinning graphene oxide fiber as an energy storage unit. The fiber-TENG is flexible, knittable, wearable and adaptable for integration with various portable electronics. The coaxial fiber-SC has high volumetric energy density and good cycling stability. The fiber-TENG and fiber-SC are flexible yarn structures for wearable continuous human movement energy harvesting and storage as on-body self-charging power systems, with light-weight, ease of preparation, great portability and wide applicability. The integrated power textile can provide an efficient route for sustainable working of wearable electronics.

T1  - Antibacterial, Scalable Manufacturing, Skin-Attachable, and Eco-Friendly Fabric Triboelectric Nanogenerators for Self-Powered Sensing
JO  - Acs Sustainable Chemistry &Amp; Engineering
AB  - Textile-based triboelectric nanogenerators (T-TENGs) are an indispensable cornerstone of new wearable electronics. However, the manufacturing processes of T-TENGs usually involve complex chemical processes and expensive materials. The friction materials utilized in these T-TENGs generally come from nonrenewable resources. Here, we report the development of the scalable fabrication of a flexible, skinattachable, and eco-friendly fabric triboelectric nanogenerator (FTENG) with satisfactory comfort and excellent antibacterial properties by introducing eco-friendly green materials, Tencel and chitosan fibers. The yarn triboelectric nanogenerator (YTENG) fabricated by a scalable fancy yarn spinning technology using Tencel and chitosan fibers exhibits high flexibility, small diameter, low weight, high scalability, and productivity as well as low cost, which contribute to the widespread application of T-TENGs. Benefiting from the excellent compatibility of YTENGs, automatic weaving for producing such FTENGs is demonstrated. The output voltage, current, and power density of a fabricated FTENG operating at a single-electrode mode can reach 31.3 V, 1.8 μA, and 15.8 mW/m 2 , respectively, by applying a 3 Hz mechanical drive of 100 N with a size of 5 × 5 cm 2 . Such FTENGs have been used as self-powered sensors for body motion monitoring. This study presents a novel and sustainable strategy for the development of eco-friendly T-TENGs.

T1  - Stretchable Coplanar Self-Charging Power Textile With Resist-Dyeing Triboelectric Nanogenerators and Microsupercapacitors
JO  - Acs Nano
AB  - The
integration between energy-harvesting and energy-storage devices
into a self-charging power unit is an effective approach to address
the energy bottleneck of wearable/portable/wireless smart devices.
Herein, we demonstrate a stretchable coplanar self-charging power
textile (SCPT) with triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) and microsupercapacitors
(MSCs) both fabricated through a resist-dyeing-analogous method. The
textile electrodes maintain excellent conductivity at 600% and 200%
tensile strain along course and wale directions, respectively. The
fabric in-plane MSC with reduced graphene oxides as active materials
reaches a maximum areal capacitance of 50.6 mF cm–2 at 0.01 V s–1 and shows no significant degradation
at 50% of tensile strain. The stretchable fabric-based TENG can output
49 V open-circuit voltage and 94.5 mW m–2 peak power
density. Finally, a stretchable coplanar SCPT with one-batch resist-dyeing
fabrication is demonstrated for powering small electronics intermittently
without extra recharging. Our approach is also compatible with conventional
textile processing and suggests great potential in electronic textiles
and wearable electronics.

T1  - Predicting the Output Performance of Triboelectric Nanogenerators Using Highly Representative Data‐Based Neural Networks
JO  - Energy Technology
AB  - Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) are promising potential sustainable power sources for wireless sensing networks within the Internet of Things (IoT) realm. Developing an efficient TENG evaluation model, characterized by high speed, accuracy, and representativeness, facilitates its integration into practical applications, which is urgent and lack of investigation currently. Herein, an artificial intelligence (AI) based evaluation model is developed to predict the performance of freestanding rotational TENGs (FR‐TENGs) for demonstration. An accurate and representative train dataset is essential for development of AI‐based evaluation model, which has been generated using finite element analysis and equivalent circuit simulation alongside the non‐dominated sorting genetic algorithm II. Through comprehensive experiments and simulations, the accuracy of the model has been verified in predicting the power output performance of FR‐TENGs, which has 99.6% (three design parameters) and 99.2% (seven design parameters) maximum train set accuracy. More importantly, the predicted results from the AI‐based evaluation model have notably expanded the coverage of data and significantly expedited the generation time from days to seconds. Herein, the use of AI in assessing the performance of TENGs is enhanced. The TENG design process can be significantly simplified, while maintaining a high evaluation model accuracy, thus promising advancements of IoT applications in future.

T1  - Conductive Composite Fiber With Customizable Functionalities for Energy Harvesting and Electronic Textiles
JO  - Acs Applied Materials &Amp; Interfaces
AB  - A fiber-based triboelectric nanogenerator
(F-TENG) is an important
technology for smart wearables, where conductive materials and triboelectric
materials are two essential components for the F-TENG. However, the
different physicochemical properties between conductive metal materials
and organic triboelectric materials often lead to interfacial failure
problems, which is a great challenge for fabricating high-performance
and stable F-TENGs. Herein, we designed a new conductive composite
fiber (CCF) with customizable functionalities based on a core-spun
yarn coating approach, which was applicable for a fiber-based TENG
(CCF-TENG). By combing a core-spun method and a coating approach,
triboelectric materials could be better incorporated on the surface
of conductive fibers with the staple fibers to form a new composite
structure with enhanced interfacial properties. The applicability
of the method has been studied using different conductive and staple
fibers and coating materials as well as different CCF diameters. As
a demonstration, the open-circuit voltage and power density of the
CCF-TENG reached 117 V and 213 mW/m2, respectively. Moreover,
a 2D fabric TENG was woven and used as a wearable sensor for motion
detection. This work provided a new method for 1D composite fibers
with customizable functionalities for the applications in smart wearables.

T1  - Fish Scale for Wearable, Self-Powered TENG
JO  - Nanomaterials
AB  - Flexible and wearable devices are attracting more and more attention. Herein, we propose a self-powered triboelectric nanogenerator based on the triboelectric effect of fish scales. As the pressure on the nanogenerator increases, the output voltage of the triboelectric nanogenerator increases. The nanogenerator can output a voltage of 7.4 V and a short-circuit current of 0.18 μA under a pressure of 50 N. The triboelectric effect of fish scales was argued to be related to the lamellar structure composed of collagen fiber bundles. The nanogenerator prepared by fish scales can sensitively perceive human activities such as walking, finger tapping, and elbow bending. Moreover, fish scales are a biomass material with good biocompatibility with the body. The fish-scale nanogenerator is a kind of flexible, wearable, and self-powered triboelectric nanogenerator showing great prospects in healthcare and body information monitoring.

T1  - Scalable Textile Manufacturing Methods for Fabricating Triboelectric Nanogenerators With Balanced Electrical and Wearable Properties
JO  - Acs Applied Electronic Materials
AB  - Triboelectric
nanogenerators (TENGs) are foreseen as a leading
candidate to harvest mechanical energy from ambient sources such as
human body movements. However, wearable TENGs, which are used for
this purpose, require adequate wearability for long durations, in
addition to sufficient electrical outputs. So far, it has been difficult
to achieve this through the predominantly plastic-based wearable TENGs
constructed using conventional nanogenerator fabrication methods.
This Article evaluates the use of textile materials and scalable fabrication
techniques to develop TENGs targeting balanced electrical and wearable
properties. The fabrication process is conducted using yarn-coating,
dip-coating, and screen-printing techniques, which are common textile
manufacturing methods, and converted into fabrics using flat-bed knitting,
resulting in TENGs with improved wearable and electrical performances.

T1  - 3D Orthogonal Woven Triboelectric Nanogenerator for Effective Biomechanical Energy Harvesting and as Self‐Powered Active Motion Sensors
JO  - Advanced Materials
AB  - The development of wearable and large-area energy-harvesting textiles has received intensive attention due to their promising applications in next-generation wearable functional electronics. However, the limited power outputs of conventional textiles have largely hindered their development. Here, in combination with the stainless steel/polyester fiber blended yarn, the polydimethylsiloxane-coated energy-harvesting yarn, and nonconductive binding yarn, a high-power-output textile triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) with 3D orthogonal woven structure is developed for effective biomechanical energy harvesting and active motion signal tracking. Based on the advanced 3D structural design, the maximum peak power density of 3D textile can reach 263.36 mW m under the tapping frequency of 3 Hz, which is several times more than that of conventional 2D textile TENGs. Besides, its collected power is capable of lighting up a warning indicator, sustainably charging a commercial capacitor, and powering a smart watch. The 3D textile TENG can also be used as a self-powered active motion sensor to constantly monitor the movement signals of human body. Furthermore, a smart dancing blanket is designed to simultaneously convert biomechanical energy and perceive body movement. This work provides a new direction for multifunctional self-powered textiles with potential applications in wearable electronics, home security, and personalized healthcare.

T1  - Smart Textile Triboelectric Nanogenerators: Prospective Strategies for Improving Electricity Output Performance
JO  - Nanoenergy Advances
AB  - By seamlessly integrating the wearing comfortability of textiles with the biomechanical energy harvesting function of a triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG), an emerging and advanced intelligent textile, i.e., smart textile TENG, is developed with remarkable abilities of autonomous power supply and self-powered sensing, which has great development prospects in the next-generation human-oriented wearable electronics. However, due to inadequate interface contact, insufficient electrification of materials, unavoidable air breakdown effect, output capacitance feature, and special textile structure, there are still several bottlenecks in the road towards the practical application of textile TENGs, including low output, high impedance, low integration, poor working durability, and so on. In this review, on the basis of mastering the existing theory of electricity generation mechanism of TENGs, some prospective strategies for improving the mechanical-to-electrical conversion performance of textile TENGs are systematically summarized and comprehensively discussed, including surface/interface physical treatments, atomic-scale chemical modification, structural optimization design, work environmental control, and integrated energy management. The advantages and disadvantages of each approach in output enhancement are further compared at the end of this review. It is hoped that this review can not only provide useful guidance for the research of textile TENGs to select optimization methods but also accelerate their large-scale practical process.

T1  - Highly Flexible, Large‐Area, and Facile Textile‐Based Hybrid Nanogenerator With Cascaded Piezoelectric and Triboelectric Units for Mechanical Energy Harvesting
JO  - Advanced Materials Technologies
AB  - Despite of the rapid development and demonstrations of wearable energy harvesting devices, their industrial applications have been limited by the lack of highly flexible, scalable and facile fabrication method. Especially, few studies have involved the theoretical analysis with the relevant experimental verification. To this end, we demonstrate a highly flexible and large-area textile-based hybrid nanogenerator integrated a net-shaped nanofiber reinforced piezoelectric unit and a triboelectric unit with a micro-structured surface configuration.Electrospinning technique was used to fabricate an optimized PVDF-CNT-BaTiO3 nanofiber/particle nonwoven fabric of 18 cm×27 cm for the piezoelectric unit without further polarization. Then a large-area free-standing PDMS-MWCNT-Graphite flexible composite film of 20 cm×25 cm, optimized for the triboelectric unit was prepared by doctor-blading method. The resultant hybrid nanogenerator, with 4.5 cm×5 cm in size, generated a rectified average peak output voltage of 161.66 V, along with the highest peak power output of 2.22 W/m 2 , directly driving 150 LEDs. Importantly, explicit theoretical model for the hybrid nanogenerator were proposed and good agreements were obtained between the theoretical and corresponding experimental results, which sheds new lights on the mechanism and predicts the ways to optimize such hybrid nanogenerators.

T1  - Graphene Nanoplatelet Integrated Thermally Drawn PVDF Triboelectric Nanocomposite Fibers for Extreme Environmental Conditions
JO  - Advanced Electronic Materials
AB  - AbstractTriboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) utilize the synergetic effect of triboelectrification and electrostatic induction to guide electrons through an external circuit, enabling low‐frequency mechanical and biomechanical energy harvesting and self‐powered sensing. Integrating 2D material with a high specific surface area into flexible ferroelectric polymers such as polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) has proven to be an efficient strategy to improve the performance of TENG devices. Scalable fabrication of graphene‐integrated PVDF nanocomposite fiber using thermal drawing process is demonstrated for the first time in this study. The open‐circuit voltage and short‐circuit current show 1.41 times and 1.48 times improvement with the integration of 5% graphene in the PVDF fibers, respectively. The TENG fabric shows a maximum power output of 32.14 µW at a matching load of 7 MΩ and a power density of 53.57 mW m−2. The fibers exhibit excellent stability in harsh environmental conditions such as alkaline medium, high/low temperature, multi‐washing cycle, and long‐time usage.

JO  - Nanomaterials
AB  - The triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) developed by Z. L. Wang’s team to harvest random mechanical energy is a promising new energy source for distributed sensing systems in the new era of the internet of things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI) for a smart world. TENG has many advantages that make it suitable for a wide range of applications, including energy harvesting, environmental protection, wearable electronics, robotics, and self-powered sensors. Sensing as an important part of TENG applications is gradually expanding, with the in-depth study of TENG sensing in its working principle, material selection, processing technology, system integration, surface treatment, and back-end algorithms by researchers. In industry and academia, fluid dynamics sensing for liquid and air is urgently needed but lacking. In particular, local fluid sensing is difficult and limited to traditional sensors. Fortunately, with advantages for ordinary TENGs and TENGs as fluid dynamics sensors, fluid dynamics sensing can be better realized. Therefore, the paper summarizes the up-to-date work on TENGs as fluid dynamics sensors, discusses the advantages of TENGs as fluid dynamics sensors in-depth, and, most importantly, aims to explore possible new key areas to help guide the future direction of TENG in fluid dynamics sensing by addressing the key challenges.
